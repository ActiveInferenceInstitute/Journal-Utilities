## INTRODUCTION
00:05 _Daniel:_
[[start:5900][end:9460]] Hello and welcome, everyone, to the Active Inference Institute.
[[start:9620][end:16020]] This is Session 1 of the course "Physics as Information Processing" with Chris Fields.

00:20 [[start:20366][end:23540]] And then we'll carry on with the first lecture,
[[start:23620][end:24152]] here.
[[start:24286][end:44084]] Check out the video description for a link to the [Course Overview website](https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/fields-physics-2023), where you can ask questions that will be answered asynchronously; register to participate in the discussions, which happen about two weeks after each of the six lecture sessions; and just learn more about this area.

01:19 _Chris:_
[[start:79460][end:80316]] Thank you, Ander.

01:49 [[start:109210][end:126810]] This is a course on "Physics as Information Processing," and this first session will be a historical perspective on the idea that physics is, or is about, information processing.
