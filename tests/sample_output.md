## INTRODUCTION
_Daniel:_
 Hello and welcome, everyone, to the Active Inference Institute.
 This is Session 1 of the course "Physics as Information Processing" with Chris Fields.

 And then we'll carry on with the first lecture,
 here.
 Check out the video description for a link to the [Course Overview website](https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/fields-physics-2023), where you can ask questions that will be answered asynchronously; register to participate in the discussions, which happen about two weeks after each of the six lecture sessions; and just learn more about this area.

_Chris:_
 Thank you, Ander.
