SPEAKER_00:
Alright, I think we're live.

Hey everyone, welcome to Curio Art Stream number 3.

It's Daniel and Max, and it's January 17th.

2022 and we are chilling gonna just get set up and talk about anything and uh do some art so if you're watching along live you should feel free to post in the chat and uh we're just gonna be hanging out doing art taking requests doing whatever happens over the next


SPEAKER_03:
one or two hours so welcome max let's have some fun thanks a lot for joining oh man so happy to be here um yeah super excited we just got off a call about uh voting um in the courier downs which is really informative and educational call lots of great ideas so happy to be here thanks for inviting me gannon


SPEAKER_00:
Let's see what your, can you do a little scribble on the remarkable?

And then I'm going to get the videos aligned and then I'll get out my paper.

Yep.

I think getting some themes like DAO is a theme or who knows.

Okay.

All right.

Looks good.

And there's my hand.

All right.

I'm going to dip down.

I will still be talking and listening, but I'll be...

Under my desk.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, man, how's that look?

Oh, cool.

I'm going to undo some stuff here.

So today I'm plugged into the Remarkable 2 tablet.

And it's a truly profound art making experience.

It feels like you're writing on paper.

Yeah.

And it's wifi streaming to the screen and it's really incredible.


SPEAKER_00:
Art papers are almost, almost aligned.

So like it, I'll be able to trace you.

Nice.

All right.

All right, so yeah, I have one eye on the YouTube chat.

If anyone posts anything.

Otherwise, let's pick a first theme.

Should it be Curio?


SPEAKER_03:
All right.

Should we set a timer or do you want to just go till our arms fall off?


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, let's just, let's do the arm falling off option.

Okay, sounds good.


SPEAKER_03:
I'm trying to remember what this raccoon looks like.

Ah, there we go.


SPEAKER_00:
I have him on the bottom right of the stream.

So do you ever talk and draw?


SPEAKER_03:
It's a little hard, isn't it?

Very rarely.

I feel like it's definitely using different parts of the brain, but it's all good.

I would love to just be able to make NFTs on the fly with this thing.

It'd be so awesome.


SPEAKER_00:
how's your weekend man you do anything cool uh went on a hike kind of a little bit outside of where i live and just did a little other drawing did a few requests curio requests did one on uh toe jam and earl is a video game

and yep back to the work game yeah this is the best part about drawing you could just say oh no i was warming up there that wasn't the real drawing i just did like the worst sketch just like that was a sketch oh man um


SPEAKER_03:
What else?

What else?


SPEAKER_00:
I'm hiding my letters behind yours.


SPEAKER_03:
I can't see what you're doing because I only have one monitor up.

Let me try pulling up another one.

It might mess it up, actually.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, it's fine.

It's fine.

It's like a one-way mirror.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_03:
so how do you how do you warm up for art like what do you usually do to start um oh man i don't i don't know i think i just jump in i've done it for some you know so many years i don't have that like have that process to warm up it's just like just jump in i usually have a few words that i like to draw

Sometimes just doing scribbles is fun too.


SPEAKER_00:
Yep.

Testing, slow, balance, relax.


SPEAKER_03:
Okay, I need to pull up the second monitor just so I can see what you're doing because I'm just like, what's going on over there?


SPEAKER_00:
Okay, so yeah.

This is our scribble page.

We'll get the scribbles out and then we'll

I liked it last time when we had the two sides going and they were meeting in the middle.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh yeah, that's cool.

Oh, here we go.

Okay.

I got a good preview.

I'm going to shoot it over to Twitter, get some friends over.


SPEAKER_00:
Do you like scribbles?

I love scribbles.

Scribbles are where it's at.

We like the scribbles.


SPEAKER_03:
I think at one point when I was really into scribbles, it was called Scribble Scrabbles by the homies.

To those that are listening, I still like the scribbles.


SPEAKER_00:
Okay.

Whatever you're done with that scribble missive, let's go to a new, new theme.

And if anyone has like a request, they should definitely just throw it in the chat.


SPEAKER_03:
Um, here, I'm going to clear it.


SPEAKER_00:
Okay.

Let's do either a left or a right or like a top and a bottom initial split.

And then we could do like past and future, individual and community.

Oh, past and future.


SPEAKER_03:
That's a good one.

Let's do that one.

Let's do that.

Does that work?


SPEAKER_00:
Yes.

Which side do you want to do?


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, okay.

I think future.

What do you think?


SPEAKER_00:
Okay.

And then we'll future be on the top bottom left or right?


SPEAKER_03:
Future maybe should be on the bottom or the right.

Okay, I'll do.


SPEAKER_00:
Okay.


SPEAKER_03:
How often do you draw, man?

What's your drawing schedule like?


SPEAKER_00:
I have this kind of metal plate, so I try to sneak it out during the day.

There's different genres of drawing.

For note-taking drawing, that used to be just... I used to do that for hours a day in all of school and even in grad school.

I was just taking a lot of

notes like that and then once all my work went on the computer fully i needed to set out more time to actually put the pen on the paper and so i'd say i draw a little something every day but sometimes it's like in the full sketch mode i kind of have a big uncanny valley between

actually sitting down to draw something like if it's for somebody who wants it or like a theme that I know that I really want to do versus just little scribbling.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, I think most of my notes from high school and college are just bizarre scribbles and random drawings.

Oh, man.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, I wonder how all that can be.

How could the subject just be so that that was it?

Not just to salvage the meaning of those notes, but

It's how so many people interface with a lot of the material, like little comic strips of chemistry or equations that incorporate layout and position.

Why should we be restricted to just a text file for capturing

like these incredibly rich and detailed topics.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_03:
Sorry if I go over your drawing.


SPEAKER_00:
Oh, no.

No, it's okay.

Oh, cool.

That looks like something you'd see carved into the sand dunes from 50,000 feet.

Oh, yeah.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, I think our resolutions on point today, both have really good connections.


SPEAKER_00:
Yep.

The resolution is 4096 by 2160.

And I'm streaming at 6000 KB per S. Nice.

Use that internet while it's free.

Or whatever, while it's a flat rate.

Yeah.

going into the future backwards you know able to see the past tumbling forwards backwards tracing retracing dreams memories


SPEAKER_03:
God, I really wonder to what extent our future experiences alter our past experiences or change the perceptions of the past.

I don't know.

Is that even possible?

I don't know.

Science is weird.

Oh, man.


SPEAKER_00:
There's always like a low bar and a high bar.

Like new information can come in that causes us to reinterpret the past.

That happens all the time.

But then it's like, so should we be expecting something even more than that to establish whether the future could influence the past?

Is the present just like a bottleneck?

All changes only go one way.

But yeah.

Oh, nice.

It's a whale.

It's a crypto whale.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, people in the chat, you can definitely ask random questions.

Otherwise, I think... We're still running Core 2 Duos over here.

So one hand is for drawing.

That's one thread.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, man, I finally upgraded to a desktop.

I've always been on laptops the last time.

Oh man, 15 years or so.

And I'm just so excited to be able to, I'm right now I'm running on a laptop, but I'm pretty soon getting a desktop, some RTX graphics card and just, oh man, cannot wait.

So excited.


SPEAKER_00:
it's a whale with a top hat I'm thinking like what is in the future oh well what's kind of cool is like the part that in red that I did underneath it it is still there even though the whale the hat of the whale is over the block letters oh nice nice oh I love that that's so cool


SPEAKER_03:
I wish this Remarkable tablet had some onion skinning so I could pull the stream in as it's going to make it truly... Wait, what do you mean onion skinning?

Oh, like I can see the YouTube stream underneath it.


SPEAKER_00:
Oh, like drawing on a video tablet.

Yes, yes, for sure.


SPEAKER_03:
All that talk about DAOs earlier gets me thinking about like, maybe we should make a drawing DAO.

Draw down.

Draw down DAO.


SPEAKER_00:
What, what would it be?


SPEAKER_03:
I mean, we just draw and mint it and then, you know, all the funds just go back into it and something like that.


SPEAKER_00:
It's any, any drawing material?

Oh, what?


SPEAKER_03:
I mean, like, somebody would want one of these NFTs.

I mean... Yeah.

Or maybe not.


SPEAKER_00:
It's going to be the refrigerator.

The kids drawing on the refrigerator of the future.

Oh, man.


SPEAKER_02:
Draw.


SPEAKER_00:
Draw down.

Um...

Nice.

That was very, very quick character there.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_00:
So I see like the kind of ambivalence, like the arms are reaching in, but they're kind of like, is the arm inside or outside the future?

Like, are we reaching into the outside or is it reaching into us?

And then.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_03:
There's something really profound about these, the inverted arms.

It's like, huh.

Yeah, it's very meta to me.

Sometimes I make them drawing each other, which I find hilarious.

Or I'll have one draw another one that's a better copy.

And I always think that's hilarious.


SPEAKER_00:
It's like the Escher.


SPEAKER_03:
Well, it's like the poor quality one drawing the higher quality one.


SPEAKER_00:
That's like the bootstrap DAO formalizing mechanisms for a more complete DAO.

Like you got to start with a rough sketch and then you can develop the next layer.

Okay, wait, I'm going to get a pillow to sit on.

Be right back in a second.


SPEAKER_02:
Okay.

Okay.


SPEAKER_00:
Okay.

Whenever you're ready for a new theme, I did remember something to talk about or to kind of bring up.

What would be a cool theme?


SPEAKER_03:
I think I'll save it.

I'm just going to...

make a fresh page.


SPEAKER_00:
Now people can see that was my naked drawing underneath.

Okay.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh man, that's awesome.

And you're saving all those too, right?


SPEAKER_00:
These ones that I'm drawing?

Yeah.

I definitely need a better physical infrastructure for like, I don't know.

When was it made?

When was it?

What was it for?

Or just like a file cabinet, but...

um better okay anyone of course can always suggest a theme um yeah what's what theme do you want to do how about expression okay oh man all right

So over the holidays, I read multiple biographies of William Blake.


SPEAKER_03:
Nice.

He's one of my favorite all-time artists.

That's awesome, man.


SPEAKER_00:
Oh, dude, me too.

That's funny.

Holy shit.


SPEAKER_03:
I didn't know that about you.

That's awesome.


SPEAKER_00:
No, he was such an interesting fellow, of course.

Okay, so English poet William Blake, for those who are not familiar.

So his life was very interesting because he never moved more than like a couple of dozen miles from London.

He pretty much lived in London and the big like events and travels in his life were to like, I'm not familiar with the geography, but he didn't go further than

a hundred miles or something like that.

But of course he had such a tremendous mythology and creativity and he made poetry and he made manuscripts that fused text and illustration into these illuminated printings.

And so then here's the part where it's sort of like

made me think about expression and crypto and art.

All right, so some of these biographies are very technically oriented.

Like they're very much about his printing career because he was a craft artist.

Like people paid him to make etchings of different things, like for books and for poems and whatnot.

And then he also made his own personal work on the side.

And it seemed like the way that things worked was like a drawer would make a drawing and then the engraver would engrave the drawing onto a plate so that it could be mass produced.


SPEAKER_02:
Yes.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah.

And then...

And so it's like you have like the sheet of metal and then the etcher, you know, makes the etching.

And then you put the thin roll of paint and then you press that down on the paper.

Wipe the top off.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_00:
Exactly.

Yes.

And so Blake kind of convergently evolved slash pioneered.

the like almost the opposite of that method which he called the infernal method which is related to like marriage of heaven and hell's um book but he started with a plate and then he painted with an acid resistant ink and then dipped the plate into a corrosive bath so then it it ate away the parts that hadn't been drawn and

And so that allowed the drawer to do the art by hand, but then also for that to be printed.

And so he had big dreams that that would be a way to mass produce, but also retain the total sovereignty of production into one person's art.

So like that kind of reminded me of just, I don't know, like signing.

Like when something has the text and the art, it's in its unaltered form.

Like today we'd have a checksum or something and verify that it was the one that people thought it was.

But if it's just like a text, then I don't know, people could contextualize it differently or...

modify something but then for the visual and the text to be so intermingled and then for that to be done in one step it's almost like sealing it with a sealing it with a kiss but sealing it with a with a seal because then yeah so i don't know what what aspects of blake do you like or what


SPEAKER_03:
I was first drawn to it because I, when I first saw it, I thought it was from the 1970s.

And then when I found out how old it was, I was just so blown away.

And then I, you know, I studied printmaking.

I got my BFA in printmaking and I just love those etching techniques.

Yeah.

And just connecting with him on that level too.

And yeah, just huge, huge fan of etching.

I could,

I never had to have these really high-level needs of producing income and making money.

I would just do etchings all day.

And it's pretty toxic, though.

I invented some processes where I transferred laser print to copper plates and then used it as kind of a resist.

And I developed that from...

you know, etching circuit boards and kind of extending that and, um, really generating like a full, uh, range of tones and colors.

And so I got really into that, um, just the process and all the times, you know, friends and other, uh, instructors would be like, you know, your stuff doesn't really look that interesting.

Like,

maybe try focusing on like the social art or more, uh, more interactive stuff.

Cause that's way more interesting from, from an interesting perspective in life, but I just truly love it.

And, um, you know, I did produce some stuff that was kind of cool looking, but, um, man, yeah, the, the, the master printers go through so much just to like, you look at a print and if you didn't understand, understand the process, you'd be like, Oh, that's easy.

They just like printed it out.

And yeah,

And this is not that easy.

And, um, yeah, it just gets really, really involved.

Um, but a truly profound process, like the whole, um, process where you create a resist and then, um, you can remove it and then throw it into acid and print it like talking about spending hundreds of hours, um, just kind of getting the basics down so you can produce something kind of interesting.

Um,

Really, really awesome artist.

It's so futuristic, what's going on with this stuff.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, I mean, his apprenticeship began very young and he was a devoted craftsperson.

Maybe the printer has made it seem like printing is easy now that it's the easiest it's ever been.

But then now printing is a hassle.

So now it's like the other way.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, gosh, yeah.

If you try printing now and do it with compliance and using solvents and all that, I mean, you're dropping many, many tens of thousands of dollars to do it right.

I just can't imagine.

It's not being cost-effective.


SPEAKER_00:
To do a classical print?


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, yeah, with all the acid and the time that it takes and...

Have you ever, do you ever take a printmaking class or do any, uh, you know, stuff?


SPEAKER_00:
Uh, I think I've done silk screen, like t-shirt.

I've, I've helped with that, but never, I've never done the infernal method.


SPEAKER_03:
Your, um, yeah, your line art would translate really well to a screen printing or seriography.

Um, seriography.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_00:
Serigraph.


SPEAKER_03:
Huh?


SPEAKER_00:
One friend, Ryan, he took some of my drawings and did a laser etching on like wood and leather, glass.

It looked really cool.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, that's awesome.


SPEAKER_00:
That's awesome.

Oh, here's a great question from Minted Yesterday.

Thanks for the question.

Also, Constantine, thanks a lot for the support and the comment.

So Minted Yesterday wrote, hey, draw DAO drawers.

So it's official, Max.


SPEAKER_03:
Okay, that's the next name.


SPEAKER_00:
Triple D, diners, drive-ins, and dives.

Have you guys tried drawing in VR spaces?

What is it like drawing in midair versus other mediums?


SPEAKER_03:
cool question holy crap they just i was i told i'm so glad you asked that question i just um had so i got a oculus and i only got it to do 3d modeling um i'm not a gamer i i definitely um i've tried my whole life i've never been to playing games i'm more on the architectural side of

experiences and for some reason just games don't resonate to me so i didn't get it for that i got it just to do these 3d sculptures um so i helped set up the tv station here in chico california also on the board of the library in both those institutions we got um some vr sets so i got to try them out um had just some incredible experiences producing vr sculptures with tilt brush um so i bought oculus's

you know, a few hundred bucks, which wasn't too bad.

And then, you know, bought all of the 3D modeling programs.

So the last couple of weeks in the evenings, I'll jump on there and just start sculpting these crazy things.

And I swear it's the truly the most profound experience drawing I've ever had.

It's unreal.

You can work on things real small in front of you and blow them up as big as you want and then paint on them.

There's a graffiti app too that you can go up on walls and graffiti with people in VR.

It's like, oh man, there's so much killer stuff on there.

So yeah, I think I would recommend it for everyone who likes to be creative and looking forward to more apps and more tools are going to be producing with the Vive or the Oculus, I should say.


SPEAKER_00:
I've never done it, but...

here's a few thoughts like when we're drawing on uh well this is three-dimensional it's it's just thin but you know what i mean when i say two-dimensional so like when it's two-dimensional drawing there are all these tricks to make it pop and have rhythm and three-dimensionality like i've

Like, this will be seen as a person with an arm bent behind a leg, even though, of course, it's not.

But that's, like, the brain doing stuff.

And so once you open up the ability to actually draw in three dimensions, does that mean that you can suggest a fourth dimension?

Or, like, does that... What illusions or...

spaces for somebody else to view it.

Of course, people can view it from different angles.

That doesn't really matter as much for a paper drawing.


SPEAKER_03:
Well, and maybe in some, we don't even know.

I mean, maybe we are, maybe it,

without even knowing it, you know, just the act of this is a virtual experience.

You know, we are drawing in some virtual reality of sorts right now and people watching this in the future, you know, is some fourth dimensional experience and, you know, and, you know, maybe someone else can remix this stuff too and add it to their, their artistic process in the future.

So maybe it is going to be fourth dimensional.


SPEAKER_00:
It was always 40.

Always was.


SPEAKER_03:
I remember talking with some friends on some nature hike in the forest somewhere in Santa Cruz.

We're talking about...

I think you know where I'm going with this.

So we were having a long excursion into the forest, these beautiful trees up in the hills and trying to visualize like what a human, you know, looks like in the fourth dimension over a long period of time.

And my best visualization is like, it kind of looks like a long

worm you know so you're taking snapshots of the human's growth over a long period and it kind of if you're looking at it from afar you just see like a small tail grow and you know the human body gets bigger over time then it decreases but if you take snapshots of it and stack them real thin together you'll get this kind of like long thin worm you know and some and then towards the end it just kind of fades out and tapers off into particles so it kind of looks like it's like a

forget to kind of draw it on here it's kind of like worm they kind of like you know yeah man it's so hard to it's hard to illustrate um but yeah it was a definitely an interesting visualization and fifth dimensional forget about it can't can't capture that can't even get close to magic but anyway yeah i had some other other people had other ideas too and all that

could be perceived and like, maybe, yeah, maybe we're just space worms.

Maybe that's what our, what we really are to some other creatures.


SPEAKER_00:
Blake said human is a worm of 60 winters.

So it's actually like very related.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh man, that's great.

That's a great quote.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah.

This one book I have over here, it's like Blake and Biological Symbolism.

I think it's called Scattered Portions.

And I was like, wow, that sounds like it's going to be super deep.

It kind of was, but also it was just like kind of documenting all the cases where different life forms were used in the poetry and then what the symbolism was associated with it.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_03:
Nice.

That's awesome.


SPEAKER_00:
What is this new dark part?

Oh, you can change the color on something after you draw it.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, dark part.

I don't know where I did a gray.

I changed it to gray.

Maybe that's what you're saying.


SPEAKER_00:
Can you?

Oh, okay.

So there's, there's black and


SPEAKER_03:
Black, white, and gray.

I have red and blue, but it takes a little bit to render.

I could show you what that looks like.

It's kind of cool.


SPEAKER_00:
Let's do a new red, white, and blue.

Okay.

Cool expression.

Nice.

There's the one that I drew underneath it.


SPEAKER_03:
Red, white, and blue theme.

I'll hop on blue.


SPEAKER_00:
What was the other theme you suggested?


SPEAKER_03:
That was a good one.

Individual, collective.

Collective is good.

That's a really good theme.

Oh, the DAO, do you want to do a drawing DAO theme?


SPEAKER_00:
Sounds good.


SPEAKER_03:
Okay.

Do you want to start on a preferred side?

Do you have interest there?


SPEAKER_00:
Okay, how about I'll take the left side.

Okay.

Left half.

It will be a drawing DAO flag.

oh okay um because many flags have red white and blue should i should i draw like the form of the flag uh like the outer form uh yes sure okay do one bounded rectangle a big bounded round table okay i'm gonna do a kind of a um an interesting shape just to kind of right it's a who said that the flag had to be always shown okay perfect i got you yeah


SPEAKER_03:
okay and then i'll yeah i think that's a good form right it's kind of like a waving um i don't know what you call it like tessellatory tessellation oh man i don't even know i mean is it yeah it's it's close it's close to a tessellation you know that song wave and flag it's a classic

You should get a DJ next time too.


SPEAKER_00:
I think a DJ or a few other people who want to fill the dead air.


SPEAKER_03:
I know we're not necessarily particularly good at filling the dead air.


SPEAKER_00:
We're making art here.

Yeah, exactly.

If all you have to do is talk, it's easy.

We're chewing gum over here.

Okay, I outlined your flag.

Then I will do red on the so should I stay?


SPEAKER_03:
I should just stay on blue then right?

Or what do you what are you thinking?


SPEAKER_00:
I did the outline in black, and then you do blue and I'll do red inside.


SPEAKER_03:
Okay.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah.

I'm still thinking about just like the 3d drawing.

Maybe I'll come chill.

We'll do drawing or I'll get a VR.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah.

There's.

Oh man.

I'll you know what?

Tonight I'll send you a recording recording of it.

You're going to be like, no way.

This is real.

Like this exists.


SPEAKER_00:
Drawing never goes out of style.

So what are the draw DAOs memes?


SPEAKER_02:
Oh man, I don't know.


SPEAKER_00:
To draw and not to, you know, dot, dot, dot.

To draw and not do photography.


SPEAKER_03:
I have a little bit of advantage of the undo button on here.

I just realized.


SPEAKER_00:
Well, that's like the big sticky topic, probably.

I mean, what are the future governance hurdles in drawing DAO?

Pencil versus pen?

Analog versus digital?

Oh, man.

You can't just undo.

Whatever, Grandpa.

Yeah.

it's almost like it's an opportunity for the guilds that we didn't have to kind of come into existence like it's with everything with just with all the excitement around dows and like both of us exploring different things but just if someone says

I want a regional by interest DAO.

I want the California Hiking DAO or something.

It is just an organization, but it almost like allows a group of people to start their own guild structure.

It's not like starting an organization, even an online organization,

was impossible two years ago, 15 years ago.

But it's cool that there's such excitement around maybe escaping or starting to diminish our regime of attention towards platforms.

that don't respect our psychology or attention or values and starting to see that kind of split up into a landscape of more self-selection and more like affinity on a certain topic oh graph paper versus unlined


SPEAKER_03:
Oh man, I'm trying to get that text really dialed in.


SPEAKER_00:
I feel like... Text play versus abstract drawing.

Oh man.

Hey, we invented the keyboard so we wouldn't have to do lettering.

No, dude.

We the drawers.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, there's all these political divisions that could happen really quickly with this.

in the drawing world oh no i was just thinking like just line paper versus graph paper like just can't agree with you daniel yep gotta do line paper it's authentic to the drawing experience what is another oh like um

An L-shaped ruler, maybe?


SPEAKER_00:
Oh, drawing accoutrement.

Well, yeah, so there's the media, tools, subject matter, genre.

Yeah, can you use your angle?

maybe some people like attach the drawing device to a pendulum or to a spirograph controversial is that really drawing is it drawing engineering is that okay and it's also so fun because it's like it does bring one to the kinds of governance questions that matter off the page

but we need to practice on some that are a little bit lower stakes sometimes oh man solo drawing versus collaborative drawing oh and i like that it's drawing um the pen on the right or the pencil on the right it's drawing

It's drawing off the page, and then you have one red line, and then I have one red line.

So it's kind of like everybody can break out of the box in their own way if we have a drawing down.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, it's so good.

I'm trying to think of other...

I'm going to try to line up some stuff on those bars.


SPEAKER_00:
Drawing maxis, only drawing versus people who dabble.


SPEAKER_03:
I think also, yeah, it's like the kind of that recursive idea of like creating our own culture, like drawing our own community, drawing, drawing to me is like the, I have mixed feelings about it because I know there's some artists that just only draw, but

To me, drawing is like the, it's like a primitive, right?

It's like the first thing you do to express the idea, but man, artists take it so far where it's like, you know, only in charcoal.

And I've always thought those as very basic.

I mean, my perspectives change on it, but it's something that may not last a long time if it's just on paper.

I've done some drawings of where I took like charcoal and put them on like a huge sheet of paper, like a eight by 12 sheet, and then put another sheet underneath it and then collected people's footprints when they walked over it.

And so I had other people drawing through the act of walking on top of this paper and transferring it and printing it on this other sheet.

So yeah, I mean, you know, studying art, just went through all these different types of practices of like, how can you make a line?

You know, how can you, you know, evolve it?

These, yeah, really fun stuff there to figure all that out.


SPEAKER_00:
All right, on the bottom.

we draw together to stay together.

And then on the top, lend a hand, drop a line.


SPEAKER_03:
Nice.

Oh, do an exacto knife too.

That's a pretty good drawing tool.


SPEAKER_00:
How does the exacto get used for drawing?


SPEAKER_03:
Well, I've never done that.

it's just, you cut out shapes.

It's like, it's another way to make, um, you could say if you're doing like collage or like drawing around the shapes.

Um, yeah, I've used it.

I've used it a lot for that process.

Cause it's, it's like, well, what is it?

Is it a sculpture?

You're just cutting it on a 2d surface.

It's like, well, that's not a sculpture that a painting.

So whenever I use like experimental tools for process, I'm always looking at like, what is that?

Um,

know what category of art does that fit into but i mean even a razor blade is a good one um yeah i mean you can draw anything you can pick a stick up you should put a stick in there too it's kind of like curio one through ten the evolution of human history or like the stick


SPEAKER_00:
It's very like Marshall McLuhan with the whole media and information changes.

There are changes that are happening that are bigger and faster than any media transformation that has happened so far.

Like even just that the Remarkable that you're using or any sort of digital tablet.

I mean, those have only been around for a short period of time.

But clearly they...


SPEAKER_03:
fundamentally change the game oh definitely yeah i mean and how does this change our perception of using that's why i'm always like always go back to how does how does the medium like what how does the medium and then and its intrinsic properties change how our brains function how we interact with other people how we treat other people i mean there's so much so much to be discovered and um

You know, just, yeah, what happens if you're consuming cable television all day?

Like, how does that influence the way you communicate to others?

I mean, even this, like, how is this going to change our perspectives of what NFTs are and what a DAO is?

And like, oh, man, just amazing what can happen.


SPEAKER_00:
In the digital space, sometimes it feels like there's, like, there's no constraints.

Like, it feels like, and I think that's sort of the dream.

That's like the, it's the iPhone aesthetic.

It's just all screen and there's nothing.

It's just out of the way.

You know, design should be minimal and all that.

But it really just reveals another level of actually

influencing the experience like you you can't escape the power of design and uh and then going back to the time question like we don't have the reference point or the control group to really even understand it's like we're on our own little n equals one experiments just scribbling


SPEAKER_03:
cool this looks good on the stream with the two on top we should respectively uh mint these and then people get like one of each one then they get oh a membership or something or you get you can have a your it's like a buddy system


SPEAKER_00:
like where they can fuse and make the combo drawing.


SPEAKER_03:
I've seen that on a wax.

I haven't seen that so much on Ethereum.

I'm sure it exists, but it's really easy to do it on the wax blockchain where you, you set like parameters.

Like if you have this NFT and that NFT from these different collections, then it, you burn them.

Then it allows you to mint like another one.

Yeah.

But it's not feasible on Ethereum because the gas is too high to offer that.

It's something like that.

Yeah, just holding it.

I almost prefer it's like zero expectations.

You're just like, oh, it's an NFT.

If there's enough interest, we'll find a use for them.


SPEAKER_00:
Good with this one?

Yeah.

What was that?

Good with this drawing?


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I feel like we did kind of like a mind map flag.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_03:
This is good.


SPEAKER_00:
Okay.

No one else has written one in chat.

We'll pick one theme and then anyone else should definitely suggest other themes that we can do to kind of... Okay.

There's just the drawing alone.

Okay.

What theme?

Um...


SPEAKER_03:
What is a good theme?


SPEAKER_00:
Geometry, regeneration, isolation.


SPEAKER_03:
Isolation is a major is a major theme.

I mean, I've seen so many people that are truly

fearful about going outside and getting sun and, you know, just breathing the air and like, man, yeah, there's ice.

I've seen, um, so sad to see the, the level of isolation.

Um, you know, people are just wanting to do the right thing and that process to get almost more isolated.

Um, yeah.

What about that?

Isolation?

Sounds good.

Okay.

Yeah.

You hear a weird ringing in the background.

I think the bank just got robbed next door to where I'm at.


SPEAKER_00:
Seriously?

Yeah.

You're in the Wild West.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_00:
Looking at the screen, as I look down, it's like I almost have the after image of what you drew.

But then I don't see it.

So I totally see how the AR could play out.


SPEAKER_03:
It'll be fun, man.

Yeah, we should meet up in there and do one of these in VR.

It's just so profound.

It's a different level.

It's so immersive.

You kind of get these sensations that you can kind of feel the shape.

And some of the programs, like when you move the controller near the shape, it actually kind of bumps your hand, vibrates a little bit.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah.

No, but even just right now, it's almost a feeling that I haven't had.

With the After Effect, it feels like a decay.

It feels like the digital world is spilling into the page.

Because I can see both versions.

and when i was um hiking so for i was wearing a weighted backpack and then when i took it off it was um it was like not hard to walk but it was just it felt like kind of trippy because i was just used to that extra weight now i just imagined getting used to the

The digital, getting used to being in the metaverse, being super deep in the game, getting pulled out.

It's just... Or being deep in isolation for years, getting pulled out.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, the metaverse, that's a good thing.

Yeah, I have such mixed feelings on it because I think...

we've been portrayed the metaverse to be this like we are destination.

I don't know if it is, it might be more than that.

It might be something we can interface with in a terrestrial, you know, non invasively technological.

Yeah.

It may not be that we're,

tapped into it through headsets.

I think that could be just something that's been propagated by the major corporations trying to sell us on it.

I could see it being something other like you go into a community space and you're not carrying your phone, you're just there and you can engage with the smart contracts and community tools and other ways to add value that aren't necessarily owning virtual land or anything like that.


SPEAKER_00:
I mean, there's so many pieces that have to get disentangled.

There's the ownership.

Like that's when people talk about read, write, read, write, own.

Then they're like, so protocols over platforms and then ownership, governance, and being able to have a say.

Then there's the

vr ar part and then yeah using the headset it's just one modality that isn't even accessible to all people not just because it costs but like um for for various reasons and uh i agree that's kind of like a solar punk version right like you walk into a really it's like a mixed reality space but also one where

don't know it's running an open source cyber physical code so you know that it's not like just being used for surveillance yes yeah the open source metaverse movement's gonna be crazy and needed and man the people who will

use and develop just where are they are they seven are they 45 do they currently program are they just doing some other task oh i really like that like left side the person the eye

Another piece like most of the group drawing partner or larger that I've done obviously was on the same piece of paper.

So we're always rotating the paper and switching pens and kind of blurring identity and contributions that way.

But here we can both be drawing

on the same spot and that's kind of the whole joke with nfts like right click saved two people can although that's not ownership you can two people can be in the same spot in a three-dimensional space like everybody can be watching the vr baseball game from the same spot so it's a whole another set of um


SPEAKER_03:
it's like yeah scarcity is enforced by the substrate of reality in the physical plane well and we maintain autonomy too right there's this like like this is yours this is mine but you know at this moment there's this this hybrid uh consensus mechanism of sorts


SPEAKER_00:
You mean how people enforce who owns what?


SPEAKER_03:
Right now, we have this third thing that's coming out of there that is a combination of our intellectual property of sorts.

This is perfect.

This goes back to the DAO thing.

We're making this thing together.

It makes sense to put it into a DAO because what is the third thing that comes out of this?

It's a unique partnership.

There isn't laws that govern


SPEAKER_00:
things like this you know it's like i have this art you have that art but there's a third thing that's created that's really unique that is very it is very interesting that almost makes me think about um like technology development and patents like you develop one part another person develops another part so they're both necessary neither of them are sufficient but

Who gets to say?

This reminds me of, your side reminds me, just so people can see it.

There it is.

That reminds me of like the Escher, just buy, exactly.

Fix your isolation, buy something.

With the waterfalls and just like flowing.

They're like, they're crying.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, man, yeah.


SPEAKER_00:
There's so much confusion, sadness, and despair.

Why?

B-U-I?

Flip letters.

Why be you?

Why should you be you if you're isolated?


SPEAKER_03:
Okay, I'm going to do another one of those.

That's a good one.


SPEAKER_00:
Why don't you be someone else?

You can be someone else.

Wow, that's so good.


SPEAKER_03:
I almost get this weird vibe that we're contemporary Bob Rosses almost like might be some, some people in the future, like, you know, flexing because they watch this or like, Oh yeah, I know Bob Ross.


SPEAKER_00:
I watched Bob live.

He inspired people to draw slash paint, right?


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

I mean, there's people that go spend money on paint almost every day in the world because of him.


SPEAKER_00:
Or maybe the next Bob Ross is a collective.

So now, on the bottom right, you enter... Enter... Materialism... Etc.

Buying.

And then you only recognize the sort of... It's like Soylent Green is people.

It's like, wait, I was the product?

No!


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, I really wonder how just years of people seeing things on the shelves of stores has affected their psychology about thinking what, you know, do we turn into things on shelves?

Do we become a product on the shelf?

Or do we see that as like something that is, you know, something that we should follow in that path?

Yeah.

Oh, man.

It sure is.

Really interesting.

Yeah.

How do products on the shelf affect your psychology?

And it's just that pressure to be something for sale.


SPEAKER_00:
Yep.

This is how things are presented when they want to be sold.

Wow.


SPEAKER_03:
Do you know if anyone's doing

governance or to our research or anything like that at the university level?


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, great question.

Actually, there's a group called MetaGov that I've been in for a little bit, and it's bringing together a lot of researchers in different departments at universities and more on the practitioner side.

There isn't a...

uh dao department of research but there's a ton of interest in related topics it's almost like the the the speed the generation time of the academia is um it's just like you have to just

What year would somebody have to start being a professor or whatever to be able to have that be their research focus?

So certainly some people who are already in the game will pivot their research to study this kind of stuff more.

But I can't think of any specific... There's been conceptual papers, papers on Ostrom and economics, modular governance.


SPEAKER_03:
That Ostrom book, Governing the Commons, is really good.

I highly recommend it.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, and that's totally... That's the whole public goods angle, right?

feel like that will be a key meme because once people get really excited about contributing to public goods and we start to figure out how to oh you know open source software is a public good and the information commons as a public good there will be a whole toolkit we won't just be lost in how new and different it is so oh it's like fishing or it's like some other commons

and I'm doing a research project right now with several colleagues we should be done by the end of February where we're doing some I hope that we're making something that will help people conceptualize and design DAOs and cyber physical systems especially related to DeSci like decentralized science

So maybe I'll share more.

We can have another discussion when the paper's out.


SPEAKER_03:
Awesome.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_03:
I did this conference called Dackathon.

It's at dackathon.com.

So, you know, in the EOSIO communities that have primarily been part of the last four years with crypto, we used...

this software that allowed us to make DAOs very easily.

And, um, you know, we're calling them DAX over there, decentralized autonomous communities.

Um, and anyway, these DAOs, you know, made it, made a few different community ones that had great success.

And I don't want to get into that because it's, it goes down these rabbit holes, but, uh, we made one, an event that comes out of kind of this, this, um,

distaste for traditional conferences because there's so many crypto conferences and um myself and a bunch of other friends came to this kind of this uh consensus around like you don't know if you're gonna like get equitable value out of it if you're really going to meet that one speaker you wanted to connect with or you know find that one um

If you're there to get an investor, you don't know if it's going to hit.

It's like gambling.

Every time you go to one of these things, you may get an employee or connect with someone that's awesome, but it's hit or miss.

I was like, let's make a more equitable conference.

At first, everyone thought we were going to be doing it in person.

I'm like, no, no, we got to do this online first.

This predates the COVID days.

um so kind of ahead of its time so we met up online with um i think a few hundred people came to it first and you know everyone put in a little bit of uh the eos token into a pool and then we decided what um what the dow was going to be so we collectively came up with the concept of the conference and the token and the voting process and the whole thing it's all online too if you search um

Yeah, at DACathon on YouTube, you can find some of the footage.

I think the main day where we created the DAO and the test tokens, it's about a 14-hour conversation.

And yeah, it's mostly just talking about it and figuring it out.

The actual implementation is really easy.

So we ended up with a bunch of custodians and it ended up being called MetaDAC.

And the primary function was to teach

teach through education um we've had a few events i think we're having one this year it'll be our fourth one um yeah and the software we used was created by this company decoco which ended up creating uh the game alien worlds and supporting the shirt today um interesting and yeah and alien rules is now one of the top used blockchain applications and top used blockchain games

um it makes up most transactions on the wax blockchain and um there's a standalone game on dsc as well that is it's really really worth checking out um also the biggest use of nfts is really um kind of an unusual use case that no one knows about most people think it's in collectibles or art or who knows what but most nfts that are being used are from alien worlds


SPEAKER_00:
um yeah i want to say there's like a couple hundred thousand daily users what are you gonna say i was just wondering like do you think that there's any gray or dark chain nft like not on public chains somebody could just fork evm or fork some other system and then just like in supply chain or

quality control or something like that somebody could just already be using it but just chooses not to call it by this acronym because they perceive that it's not like going to be understood um yeah there's definitely a lot of private uses for blockchain through supply chain stuff um but to me there's almost this absurdity it's like they could just do it with the


SPEAKER_03:
decentralized database structure.

It doesn't even need a blockchain.

It might have just bought into it because it was like a buzzword.

But yeah, there's some interesting use cases for that.

I haven't been particularly interested in the private uses of blockchain

in the private sector, unless it's for like, you know, experimentation.

I could see someone deploying a, you know, a unique, you know, telecated proof of stake chain or something for internal use.

But yeah, it just doesn't make sense.

It's like, why would, why is it necessary to just use like a old school database and then

take a snapshot and put it on some like internal IPFS system or, Oh man.

Yeah.

I don't know.

I've been to presentations where they try to sell you on, on that in the Bay in SF, like going to some ship, some, uh, I don't even want to say which one they were to be honest.

Cause I want to, uh, yeah.

Uh, be on record saying that, but yeah, there's, I don't know.

Just, it's always felt weird to me for sure.


SPEAKER_00:
Hmm.

Yeah.

It's always funny driving in the Bay, every billboard, it's about like data as a service and cloud.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh yeah.

It's really weird to see.

Last month when we were down in Miami seeing billboards for crypto products, I'm like, what?

Like, this is, this is weird.

We're seeing them like in the Uber, there's like crypto ads coming up on the screen on the back of the car.

I'm like,

This is so strange to see this stuff.


SPEAKER_00:
Nice, this one's looking almost done.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, this is a good one.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, I'm trying to look at what it... It also reminds me of the Lorax.

in the factory that just pumps out the, uh, like noxious stuff.

So it's kind of like, there's the, the one slur he's isolated up in his little, up in his little cave or whatever.

No more truffle lump trees, just isolation.


SPEAKER_03:
So sad.

Yeah.

I kind of like, I think I'm pulling out like a ready player one, um, vibe here too.

Um,

like the stacking of the buildings.

Have you seen that movie?


SPEAKER_00:
Ready Player One?

No.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, man.

Yeah, it's pretty dystopian.

Definitely worth checking out.


SPEAKER_00:
Is it a metaverse classic?


SPEAKER_03:
It's a metaverse classic.


SPEAKER_00:
Metaverse starter pack.

It's ahead of its time.


SPEAKER_02:
Hmm.


SPEAKER_00:
oh man also there's like no single alignment so the person on the bottom left there


SPEAKER_03:
Oh man.

Okay.

What do you think?

Should we call it?

This is a good one.

There's some, there are some deep, deep things.


SPEAKER_00:
Good.

Let's, let's do a, let's do one more chill one like this.

Okay.

All right.

So check, see if anyone, okay.

All right.

What, what do you want to do for a theme?

Um,

start listing some objects around me.


SPEAKER_03:
Vision.

Yeah.

The William Blake thing is like, like a vision and visionary.

How about that?


SPEAKER_00:
Nice.

Yes.

For vision.

And maybe we don't have to like have the year on there, but I think like a new year vision, a new vision for the new year, a vision for, for 2022.


SPEAKER_03:
Okay.

Yeah, that's good.

I like that.


UNKNOWN:
Okay.


SPEAKER_00:
I'll wait to see what you do for the first piece.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, wait.

I did this backwards a little bit.


SPEAKER_00:
Is it backwards?


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, no, no, no.

I was going to put arms on this too, because I think it's hilarious, but I needed to draw the two first.


SPEAKER_00:
We're only one month away from February 22nd, 2022.


SPEAKER_02:
That's a good day.


SPEAKER_00:
Okay.


SPEAKER_03:
I forget how precise I can be with this tablet.

Like it's kind of a...

kind of surprised every time I really get into it.

Most of the time I just scribble on it.

I'm like, oh, I can actually like really pull out some detail.

I wish there was a fill bucket on here.

I know it takes up a lot of processing to do that on something like this.


SPEAKER_00:
To do the auto-detect and fill?


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, it's involved.


SPEAKER_00:
It really does remind me of the baby...

trying to flip the page like they only know like they only know the digital version try to like swipe the page on a real book but it's like seriously i'm looking down and i i'm expecting to see it projected it just okay nice a hat 22 with a fedora yeah


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, nice.

I love the stuff in the hands.

OK, so I'm going to try to do some funny eyes.

Keep them all lined up.

Oh, I thought I lost it for a second.

I was like, no.

Are you doing any teaching this semester or just research?


SPEAKER_00:
I'd say unconventional teaching, like in...

active inference lab.

I think we're all teaching and learning together.

So I'm not assigned any institutional teaching role.

But every week, like multiple times per week, I think there's a bunch of us who are learning and teaching each other.

I'm kind of in a spot where

like a postdoc has the most time for research.

Not every postdoc, et cetera, et cetera.

But like, it's kind of the point where the administrative requirements are the lowest that they'll ever be for some people.


SPEAKER_03:
Awesome.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, I know.

I'm just enjoying it.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, when I was teaching at the college, I was like,

never no one's like ever checking up on you i'm like i don't know how i feel about this like like i need i need feedback on my teaching practices and and you only get that if you like really mess up didn't get feedback but for the most part it's like hands off um like too much autonomy like yeah is this what we're supposed to be doing but it just goes to show there was just such little um


SPEAKER_00:
with my particular institution as well so what do you think about like a course or like a d school like a decentralized school or something for artists like cryptopop with a guild has kind of

surely is exploring topics like that, but what you went through the IRL education pipeline.

So what is the, uh, what should you have known?


SPEAKER_03:
Well, Oh man, that's a good question.

I mean, I've, I've even, I first started there.

So I taught, you know, out the college for four years and printmaking and some design.

Um,

And then, you know, I was also a mentor through different school clubs and did a lot of work experience offering units for people helping out with my different businesses and such.

And yeah, so when I got there, I started helping out with writing a degree called the business of art.

And, you know, came up with all the classes, the curriculum, and it's just like, wow, this is a

huge undertaking and then submitted it to like the curriculum committee.

And, you know, and I'm like, this is absolutely insane how much work it is to go through this process.

Um, cause in the real world, you're like, Hey, you want to learn something?

Here's a, here's a class.

And then you literally just offer it on YouTube and then you get people watching your content.

Right.

Um,

and so yeah so i was definitely um learned a lot about you know how long things take and um the absurdity of that and the structure and so i think that you know if the objective is just to add value i don't know if the traditional structures are needed for that i feel like there's enough tools to distribute the content and um

get it out there without that.


SPEAKER_00:
You mean without an institution?


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, without a church institution.

So yeah, mixed feelings there.

And I even think for funding now too, it's like so many options for that.

You don't need personal things to

go through that structures.

Anyway, mixed feelings.

I said, eventually we found out I've been doing all this work.

Like they're like, there's no way we're going to allow you to make this program.

And it was just like this massive waste of time.

Like, Oh no.

Like, so anyway, kind of discouraged from, you know, creating such curriculum in that manner.

But at the same time, yeah, it was a valuable lesson.

definitely kind of, yeah.

Help me reassess what, what that structure really is and you know, what, what they're trying to create out of it as well.

Like what's the, what the function of it has turned into.

Yeah.

Yeah.

What are your thoughts on it?


SPEAKER_00:
I'm, I'm just not sure or professional enough to really know because I,

kind of came into the art game through the side door.

But... I'm just thinking about how many interesting areas, especially in the digital context, like...

We're bumping up against IP, governance, economics, interpersonal relationships, technology.

It's almost like restoring the renaissance person or the general education.

And also then there's 2023.

Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

Like STEAM.

People use that for science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics.

Where does art stand alone in an education?

And yeah, I'm also very interested.

Outside of the institutions and the structures that...

have existed previously which have only been around for a short time in the grand scheme of things what else is possible and how could the unit of education be like something beyond the just the individual person i don't know just their brain could involve their body their network their portfolio like


SPEAKER_03:
I wonder if there will be some more interfaces to contemporary structures in academics.

Will there ever be something that connects to some decentralization of sorts to speed up things?

I just feel like there's some serious value with academics and

You know, it's been going on for quite some time.

One second.

I was trying to upload my stuff and I just did.

I think we got to a point where I was trying to save it, so it's all good.


SPEAKER_00:
I'm sorry, I can't let you draw that.

That's the part with the electric car, electric drawing.

You know, what happens if you just do a nice slime and then all of a sudden, oh, can't do that.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_00:
That's why it has to be open source.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, yeah.

Yeah, it kind of forced me out of it.

It's like, I got to save.

I'm like, what?

You're not supposed to just like exit the window I'm working on.

So what is 2022 bringing?

Lots of things to lots of arms.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah.

I'm seeing a lot, a lot of tangling paths and a lot of like the shape on the left looks like a lump of clay, like something that could be formed.


SPEAKER_03:
He's into some characters.

I think just to make them like a little more interesting.

Yeah.

Yeah, what are some bridges from those like traditional academic structures to the new world?


SPEAKER_00:
I think complex systems.

That's my personal bias.

But like, complexity is an it's an on ramp and an off ramp for so many things.

I just feel like any

uh view let's just say that the 2010 view whatever it was that was making the system complex then in 1950 and 1500 massively interacting subunits or syntax and semantics like whatever was making it a complex system then it's still a complex systems now it's just different so there's like the conceptual bridge but

And that conceptual bridge is often just very clear.

It's just sometimes the logistical bridge is not built yet.

Like, so how would somebody studying political science move from their current study system to like, again, like the Dow system?


SPEAKER_01:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_03:
well in that process too.

And there's, you know, if their research is being funded by, you know, other middlemen of sorts too, it's like, how do you, I guess, navigate that?

How do you, you know, they have their requirements and their needs to see a certain deliverable funding.

Yeah.

Or, yeah, I don't know, man.

It's, it seems like it's,

They're so different.

I think the systems have different properties.


SPEAKER_00:
I think you'll really like this research paper.

I can't wait to show it to you because we are kind of exploring some of these pieces.

What have been the value flows?

Where's the granting agency, the university, the publisher?

But what value flows could we have?

It could be different.

We could reward people who are learning and starting their career.

Or we could figure out... I mean, more to say when we complete it.

But I do hope that the bridge can be bi-directional.

Maybe some people...

they want to do research on these topics and they know best.

So that's like, that's where I see the collective intelligence and just respecting people from all backgrounds in, in research and application.

Just, it doesn't have to be each person being an expert in every area or experiencing every DAO.

Like we just need some who have and the right ways to work together.


SPEAKER_03:
Yes, for sure.

Yeah, especially when we start discovering more forms of community lubrication in the form of currencies or tokens or whatever they're called.

I mean, they're going to be called so many other things.

Yeah, a lot of those things drastically change.

We don't have to be earning money to meet our basic needs.

We don't have to be working what we thought was work or what we think work is.

Things will get very blurry, so to speak.


SPEAKER_00:
I want to see the chart of people who are in that zone, number of them through time.

Like, otherwise we, I think people will be needing to work for a long, long time.

But then again, it's like Bucky Fuller and making a world that works for everybody.

It,

some sort of naive, you know, take the sum and divide by the number of people type redistribution, it's not the solution.

But if within each community, trust-based redistribution is possible to support people, then why not across communities and have everyone included that way?

I mean, maybe that's where the social and the art are going to come together.

Or one aspect.

Wow.

It's like a roller coaster.

I thought 2021 was a roller coaster.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, I think it's going to be a good year.

I mean,

Off to a good start.


SPEAKER_00:
Some nice curio activity.

Never a bad thing.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah, it's amazing how many people start hitting me up whenever I get some random DMs.

There's curio activity, too.


SPEAKER_00:
historical nfts can't count them out nice we got two viewers that's awesome


SPEAKER_03:
I'm like, this is by far one of the weirdest drawing shows I think ever on the planet.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, it's a little niche, but... You never know.


SPEAKER_03:
Someone might be waiting for this their whole life.


SPEAKER_00:
They could have the overlay and be drawing a third layer.


SPEAKER_03:
yeah i tried to do a decentralized time show oh man so i was doing it at the tv station just layering and compositing different layers live and just had really powerful computers to kind of stack these things up and at one point i think i even set up like half dozen cameras like 4k cameras too um and then i did some layers where people could go on um

like one of the Google drawing products.

And then I would just import that in.

But then I found out that I was like, I needed to curate it because I was just getting like people pasting in like the craziest stuff.

I'm like, Oh no, what have I done?

So yeah, decentralized drawing when people don't have accountability is problematic.

The moral of the story is don't do a decentralized drawing show.


SPEAKER_00:
Trust or verify.


SPEAKER_03:
Yes.

Next time we should do Ethereum address deposits it and then it gives them the link after they get their NFT.

Then it's like, oh yeah, you want to draw?

Well, you got to put in enough money that it's okay if you put whatever you want.


SPEAKER_00:
Put some ink in the game.


SPEAKER_03:
but still there's problems with that too some content you can't put on YouTube and get flagged and like art is not financially gated so how to balance all of that yeah that's a tough one


SPEAKER_00:
nice i think if you draw that white line then yeah it could be good here okay yeah we had a really good day this was awesome yeah i hope that yeah i guess there's i have six or seven drawings here they only make half as much sense i'm gonna try to do a little remix with a different drawing nice


SPEAKER_03:
Oh man.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah.

It looks like the base, the base of one song with a treble of another song.

Nice.

I love it.

The Dow flag.


SPEAKER_03:
Yeah.

Let's just, uh, brains.

I mean, we've got some extra time this week.

Let's brainstorm about a Dow.

I mean, I think it'd be fun to put these in there and just see what happens.

And people like this, uh, this content, they can support it by, uh, supporting the Dow or something.

These drawings are so weird.


SPEAKER_00:
The way people could vote would be by overlaying or by commenting on each other's drawings.

It could be drawing-based communication.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, man.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, that's cool.

There's the 2022 one again.


SPEAKER_03:
I think we could do... I think on that layer...

Next time, I think you could make a higher contrast in OBS too.

Or the line work used.


SPEAKER_00:
Okay.

I'll look at the video and see what it looks like.


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, man.

This was fun, though.

Can't wait to do it again.


SPEAKER_00:
Thank you, Max.

Always a pleasure.

So hope to see you around the Curioverse, the Drawverse.


SPEAKER_03:
The Curioverse.

Oh, man.

Is that what the DAO is called?

Here, I got to make a note of that.


SPEAKER_00:
I think it's CurioDAO, right?

Curioverse?


SPEAKER_03:
Oh, no.


SPEAKER_00:
Yeah, maybe it's... The Curio ecosystem, Curioverse, Curioversality.

I think there could and should and will be many.

Absolutely.


SPEAKER_03:
Okay, awesome, brother.

I will catch you on the interwebs.


SPEAKER_00:
yes thank you max thanks everybody for watching bye everyone thanks for joining bye
