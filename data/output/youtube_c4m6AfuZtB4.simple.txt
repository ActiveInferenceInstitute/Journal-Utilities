SPEAKER_02:
All right.

Hello, everyone.

Welcome to the Curio Art Stream number two.

I'm Daniel, and I'm here with Max.

Do you want to say hi?


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.

Hey, guys.

I'm Max, also known as Marisol Vengas from Curio Cards, here to hang out, do some drawing.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.

Yeah.

So let's start with just like a drawing of the date.

And then people will just be filtering in.

We'll be looking at the live chat.

So definitely write anything if you want to incorporate it.

And then we're just going to kind of play with this overlay between our two drawing surfaces.

The physical one, which I have on the bottom, and then the digital one.

Maybe, Max, you want to describe your setup or what are you drawing on?

Yeah, for sure.


SPEAKER_05:
So my setup today is a Samsung tablet.

It's an S6 or S9 or something.

Anyway, it has one of these sensitive styluses.

It's really awesome for essentially capturing more artifacts as I draw.

So yeah, and I'm using this app called Aggie.

And yeah, it's awesome.

It's web based.

So you can easily send it across the internet to be aggregated into this live stream.


SPEAKER_03:
Cool.


SPEAKER_02:
And I just have a camera pointing down on my desk.


SPEAKER_00:
And okay, let's see.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, man, it feels so weird to draw on the tablet.

It's too smooth.


SPEAKER_02:
Yep.

Oh, wait, I was mirroring your lettering, but it's all good.

Continue.

Okay.

Nice.

Yeah, if anyone wants to write in the chat, though, we're literally just doodling, and then we'll kind of think of fun stuff to draw about, talk about.


SPEAKER_05:
Daniel, do you have a favorite art supply?

Or a tool for drawing?


SPEAKER_02:
I think I've had phases.

I think my gateway office supply was probably erasers and mechanical pencils of different diameters.

Kind of like that.

And then it was like, oh, or you could just have the pen and then never have the opportunity to erase.

And then at that point, I kind of got into the pen collecting.

So I'd say just a good set of pens.


SPEAKER_05:
Nice.


SPEAKER_02:
What about you?


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, man.

We go through phases.

I mean, I have like, you know, massive studio with like, every art supply and office supply can possibly imagine like collections of like scissors and erasers and

know different brushes and um but yeah right now my main phase i think my two favorite supplies or materials are glitter and like tape like tape like different types of tape i probably have like i don't know 50 different types of tape i've just been taping

Using them on making art and then putting paint on it and adding glitter.

And it's just like this really amazing experience.

I definitely never thought I would ever get into those as art making tools, but it's pretty, pretty fun.


SPEAKER_02:
Let's do one where, um, you draw on the left or the right and I'll draw on the top of the bottom.

Okay.


SPEAKER_05:
Um, let me pull up the preview.


SPEAKER_02:
Okay.

So pick a side and a theme.


SPEAKER_05:
Okay.

So I'll, uh, so on the, I'll, I'll take the left.


SPEAKER_02:
Okay.


SPEAKER_05:
And then, um,

What's the theme?

What's the theme guys?


SPEAKER_02:
Let's just, we can do no theme.

We can try with a theme later.

If anyone suggests ones, we can just do a freestyle and just see where we're at.

Yeah.

All right.

I'll do the right side.


SPEAKER_05:
Okay.

Sounds good.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.

I've recently read the, uh,

master and his emissary gilchrist about the left and right brain and kind of that left right distinction simplification as binaries are but brings a lot of interesting materials into the discussion like about art and science


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, what were some takeaways in that book?


SPEAKER_02:
Maybe that it's just a yes and with different kinds of thinking and they get revved up and down in their importance situationally.

And maybe that relates to what we already know about neuroimaging.

Just like these different modes of thoughts that kind of like rev up and then rev down in the brain.

and some of those having like evolutionary basis some having learned basis really deep cultural patterns and then kind of there's kind of like a like a macro and micro how does society support the distinction of uh

science and you know rationality versus art and irrationality and that narrative and that kind of more mythical mode of interpretation


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, I was thinking about how this process could produce NFTs or leverage NFTs.

You know, the NFT could be like just a badge to get into the, get to be able to create or co-create or be used to vote on content or that's one side of it.

And the other side is on the producing, you know,

some art that people can take away as well.

Yeah.

There's lots of fun, fun ideas to think about.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, definitely.

Let's talk about that.

So here's a few thoughts.

Oh, also how about you do the right side of the page, all the left side and then my hand won't.

Well, I mean, yeah.

Oh, I see what you're saying.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_05:
Okay.

I can move.

since it's kind of like a Photoshop interface, I can actually kind of move or should be able to move this over there.


SPEAKER_02:
What percentage of your art is material versus digital right now?


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, man.

Jeez, that's a tricky question.

I don't know.

I don't do too much...

Oh, maybe I do digital.

I don't know, man.

It's so hard to say.

It all kind of blends together.

I'm trying to categorize those experiences.

Probably more digital, I think.

I take a lot of pictures and drawing a lot on the Remarkable tablet.

So yeah, there's definitely...

I think I kind of wish I could do more physical stuff.

That requires me to get into the studio more.

So ideally, it would be more physical, for sure, just to be able to go through that experience.

Yeah, you mostly do work on paper.

Do you do any other mediums?


SPEAKER_02:
think uh if google slides count then more there than paper but for for classical art just paper i i've actually made art using powerpoint i mean a long time ago when i was just exploring what mediums we could make art with and


SPEAKER_05:
Um, so I was really interested in, you know, taking bizarre mediums like that.

So I made art like, you know, in Excel, changing colors of tables and, you know, making formulas that populate based upon different interactions or just, you know, having a different interpretations of those as mediums, um, reinterpreting them in different ways.

And that's been pretty fun, but yeah, I mean, uh,

Yeah, I could see Google Sheets being a awesome art tool.


SPEAKER_02:
Oh, okay.

So, but you asked about how could NFTs and community tools and meaning kind of arise from an art stream?

Yes.

So one thought was,

a website where you log in with your web three.

So you're a matter of mask or whatever.

And then that website hashes a QR code every second with your, which address you are and then like the time code.

So then I would have that website up and then be screen capturing it in OBS.

So every frame of this

video could be with the unique QR code.

So just start there just so that that would help with like information integrity.

So that you can use someone will say, Oh, but here's this video of you saying this, you go, No, I use this QR code.

So that's not a real video of me.

So that's one use.

And then people could kind of like, I don't know,

site QR codes or make NFTs from the JPEGs of that frame?


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, I was thinking there could be some consensus of which ones should be minted and then have some engagement metrics.

If you engage, you get first dibs or it's a sorted whitelist like

like some type of like whitelist that you could acquire them or bid on them, or I think there's some pretty fun things there.


SPEAKER_02:
Well, that reminds me of the kind of lines, large line drawings in the regions that are like only visible from a high air balloon.

I'm not sure you know what their official names are.

But those kind of designs.

That's always interesting.

Like which themes, which font or, uh, styles get associated with which times, which ones will be associated with, with, uh, contemporary times.


SPEAKER_01:
Oh yeah.


SPEAKER_02:
What do you think?

You're more into the real font game.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh God.

Yeah.

It's, I wish I knew more about fonts.

Um, I've been, um,

I've been asked a lot about fonts, but I'm just more into making them rather than the history of them.

There's some that I kind of like, but I'm not necessarily... I was more in the see how many I can crank out game.

But yeah, I feel like we'll go more towards more emojis, I think, and custom emojis.

I feel like

I don't really know where fonts are going, but I have a feeling we'll start abbreviating a lot of things.

I think also with BCI headsets, we'll be able to communicate a lot more effectively.

Almost like brain-to-brain interface stuff.

It'll be interesting to see how humans use lettering and letters and

you know, the written word and we're, you know, I have a feeling we're going to see a lot of major, major shifts as this technology has become available.


SPEAKER_03:
Yep.


SPEAKER_02:
Let's do one brain to brain.

So have a, have some kind of point in the middle where it's going to be like a brain crossover.

Okay.

Okay.

Like in the center of the drawing, a brain crossover, you take the right side.


SPEAKER_05:
Okay.


SPEAKER_02:
I'll make it aligned on the video, but yeah, just generally in the center.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, wait.

There's a little bit of delay.


SPEAKER_02:
You won't see it.

I'll make it line up.

You draw on the right side and then make it kind of converge towards the center point.


SPEAKER_01:
Hmm.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, man, this is fun.

Yeah.

Yeah, I had a really awesome access.

public access station with like all this, all these cameras, like there was probably like a hundred cameras in there and good internet and all the, all the materials you would need to do live video processing.

So it just like stack up lots of people's drawings.

So we'd like set up cameras on their, on their drawings.

I think one time I might've had like 10 cameras going at the same time.


SPEAKER_02:
And like 10 people, 10 people in the studio doing partner drawing.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.

Yeah.

And it's, it was all live mix too.

So it's just like stacking up all these layers and we put on some, some tunes and, and hang out.

And yeah, it was, it was just such a, such a fun experience, but yeah, the setups were taking a long time.

It was a once a week thing.

It was a pretty big limit to, to, to get people in there.

Yeah.

Really, really awesome.

It's on YouTube.

It's called the,


SPEAKER_02:
called the drawing show and I've done like 30 episodes I did it for a couple years yeah that sounds very chill I've just liked the sort of memories good times parties and meeting at places trains doing a drawing some of those drawings we still have other ones the other people have

That's like, that's what's cool about group art.

You know, you get to have something that comes away from the relationship.

And then I guess that question comes back to the question you raised earlier.

Like, how do you do that?

with the physical piece of art you get the um you know who loves the baby more question but with the digital art like how do you make it for both people maybe or all the people like fractionalized ownership of the one collective piece of art or brainstorm that people make like everyone collaborates on a mind map or a partner drawing

And then they all share like a fractional, I don't know, or a multi-sig about it or something.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.

I feel like there almost needs to be a platform in which, um, that handles like, like where let's see, we reshare the content and someone gets value out of it.

Like that could go back to the, you know, the holders of the people that captured that experience or something.

Um,

So yeah, there's some really awesome ideas.


SPEAKER_03:
Cool.


SPEAKER_02:
So I made them kind of line up.

It's like the person on the left is like connecting to this one that you drew.


SPEAKER_05:
I love like getting characters to draw other characters.


SPEAKER_02:
Oh, okay.

Cool.

That's classic Escher.

Okay.

Okay.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.

It's just so, yeah, I love that.


UNKNOWN:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_05:
I've been doing these like inverted arms for like probably like 10 years or something.

Just so funny.

I need some mirrors.


SPEAKER_02:
Cool.

You know, this is actually like, it's kind of like AR because I'm looking down and I just see kind of like the person walking alone.

But then when I look at the screen, there's like a demon or whatever.

A Furby, Kirby, I don't know what that is.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, I know.

I'm like, it's a cloud being, I'm putting some ears on him.

Yeah.

It should come up pretty soon.


SPEAKER_02:
Definitely like Tufty or something like that.

Okay.


SPEAKER_03:
Now.

Yeah.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_05:
It's like particle, particleized.


SPEAKER_03:
Cool.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_05:
For years we do these coffee shop drawing sessions, like just bringing a couple of reams of paper and a bunch of pens and let people go at it.

It's, it's always so much fun.

Also, if you want to like,

do that at a bar, people are like, what?

You're actually doing something?

Because usually people are just getting tore up, and that's kind of the whole point.

But yeah, when you start giving people activity, you start getting some really interesting interactions.

People are like, oh, you can actually do engaging things here?

What?


SPEAKER_02:
Keep it where it is.

Trying to do some detail on your side.

So you get the lines on your side.

I'm only looking at the screen, not even down.

yeah so actually this reminds me of is uh dissecting insects so usually when we're dissecting it's just like you're looking down the microscope um and then dissecting it that way but then sometimes the fancy setups there's better zoom so it actually has a camera and then it's like you're doing the dissection but you're looking to like one of the sides

So then like it's one is like, oh, you're over microscope.

That's like, well, I don't know.

That's like, well, that reminds me of just looking at the paper and drawing.

And then here I'm looking at the screen to see your drawing.


SPEAKER_05:
That's awesome.

Oh, that is so cool.

That is so cool.

The level of precision on that is such a trick.

And then when you cover it up, it's like you just see your hand.

It's really interesting.


SPEAKER_02:
Cool.

Nice drawing.

Let's do another one with, I think it just, it works a little better with you doing the right side.

Okay.

Another one.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's fine.


SPEAKER_02:
All right.


SPEAKER_05:
We're both, we're both left-handed.

I noticed.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, I guess that's true.

I'm left-handed.


SPEAKER_05:
Here, I'll do a clear screen.

That's such a good here.

I'm going to save this.

This little drawing is very nice.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.

People have a suggestion also for like a theme or something.

We're just going to chill and do it.


SPEAKER_05:
I've got two people watching here.

I'm going to select it all.


SPEAKER_02:
You know, you can just listen to music in the background.

All right.


SPEAKER_05:
So should we do a theme?


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.

So you take right.

I'll take left.

And then what should the theme be?

Um,


SPEAKER_05:
Maybe space or that's too general.

Oh, man, there's just so many ideas I have.

My first thought is like infinity, but that's like too hard to capture.


SPEAKER_02:
Let's just do it.

Let's just do infinity.

Okay.

What's your first thought?

First thought.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh man, I really like the pressure sensitivity of this.


SPEAKER_02:
Cool.

Yeah.

Like you could do, you could use OBS, capture your webcam and then capture your web, your tablet capture, and then just use that as your video.


SPEAKER_04:
Oh yeah.


SPEAKER_02:
Like for when you're on a video chat, that'd be very, very chill.


SPEAKER_05:
Someone should make a OBS plugin to mint NFTs.


SPEAKER_01:
Oh man, that'd be great.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, that's true.

Or the plugin with the QR code, that could be OBS.

It could be like a verified plugin.

I don't know.

If it just showed the hash of the most recent block or something, some way to timestamp it really well or give a trustee trusting timestamp.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, you could have it post like a state or like a screenshot of

of the view to like IPFS or something, you know, from OBS, that's a pretty...


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, you could have a screen capture of a block explorer with blocks rolling in.

But I think it'd look good visually if it were just in the corner.

You could just have the QR and then have it so that if anyone tried to crop out the QR... I mean, obviously there's more advanced versions of what this could be, but like...

it would just be really cool I feel like because otherwise there's going to be like false positives and false negatives for what people said when and that's not really conducive to having good speech even if people are using pseudonyms or not yeah for sure for sure right I made a


SPEAKER_05:
I made a, oh, what was that?


SPEAKER_02:
I'm going to ask a question from the live chat.

Zorus asks, digital art tablet question.

If I remember correctly, Wacom Cintiq Pro used to be the Holy Grail.

Is that still the case?

Or do you think the more accessible options nowadays, i.e.

iPad, are good enough tools for professionals?


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, man, I think.

Um, it's comparable, like just seeing the iPad pros and using them very briefly.

I think they're comparable.

Um, I have the note 10, um, and that's incredible for drawing and same with this, the Samsung, uh, you know, this tablet was just a few hundred bucks and it's just, it's a really a profound experience.

You get, you know, good enough sensitivity to be, um,

very dangerous artist so yeah i don't i don't think you need those cintiqs those are so expensive like and it's limited to um you know a laptop or a desktop situation so um yeah i don't necessarily think you need those but you know i'm sure there's some some bells and whistles that you can uh you know they have like custom buttons and a variety of different uh

styluses just depends to what you know how uh how hardcore you want to get with your uh with your art creations um but yeah just oh man just getting um you know just getting in the game and making art i would say yeah get one of these few hundred dollar tablets and um or you know one of these uh older note phones it's good enough


SPEAKER_02:
Okay, let me ask another question.

What about making POAPs?

So could you maybe just describe what is a POAP?

And like, how would it come into play here in this Curio community or generally?


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, yeah, POAPs.

What's the proof of attendance, I think?


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, proof of attendance protocol.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, I like that idea.

It's kind of like a receipt for your experience.

Um, I tend to think of it as like your, um, it's like, it's proving that you were there, but then, um, you know, what, if it's just a badge to prove status within a community, that's pretty cool.

But you know, what other, what other engagement could that have?

I think that's where it gets a little more interesting.

Um, you know, how do you, um, you know, give other, uh, you know,

get other, other users and neighboring communities interested in what you're doing through that.

Um, I like asking like, how do you get the different user types to align values?

You know, I think about that as well.

Um, and yeah, the interesting about NFTs is that you don't know how other communities are going to want to integrate them or use them.

And, um,

But having that scaffolding in place is really, really awesome.

So yeah, I think for communities as they grow, using those POAPs as ways to provide accessibility and different types of resources.

You see a lot of artists having kind of like,

they call them like fetishistic articles.

Like they'll have like a zine or they'll have like a physical, you know, book or some memoir of the experience.

So yeah, maybe the PO apps give you access to other physical goods or a discount on physical goods or free coupon codes to check out.

Oh man, no guardrails there.

That's what's so exciting about all this.


SPEAKER_02:
here's a few thoughts on that so when you said like kind of like something like adjacent communities why they care made me think about like the community of baseball ticket stubs it's like you're in the league you're in the same sport or at least you're in the broader category of sports so you kind of understand the um community so then having

I don't know, just that was very... It has meaning for the internal community, for the person themselves, for their relationships, for their kind of community level.

But then also...

part of it maybe they'll be private nft chains so they'll be like zero knowledge like this person's in this community but they don't have any external information on their nfts they're private like zk nfts but then also part of it is about public on layer one so just like what is that going to do for people's public and private

presentation?

Then what will the role be for kind of back channels and privacy chains, alt identities?

To what extent is this going to like really center stage one identity, your dot ETH identity?


SPEAKER_04:
Yeah, that's interesting.

That's really interesting.


SPEAKER_02:
So what are you drawing on the right side?


SPEAKER_05:
I don't know.

I really have no idea.

Yeah, I don't know.


SPEAKER_01:
That's a good question.


SPEAKER_05:
I'm definitely thinking about infinity.

Maybe I'm thinking about something that's like creating time.

It's like a machine that creates time or a machine that creates space or something.

Um, I've been doing a lot of these like standalone forms, um, not in this particular shape, but I think of them as kind of like a, it's like a standalone type of, uh, organic machine or something.

Um, yeah, I minted some NFTs, um, on, uh, recently, um, and

Yeah, they're kind of these standalone figures I drew on.

I sketched out on the digital tablet, the remarkable tablet.

And I'm like, what are these things?

I'm like, I just don't know.

I really let someone else determine and let some art historian figure it out if it's ever relevant in the future.

But yeah, just really enjoyable to make.

Yeah, it's more about the process and less about the content for me, I think.

Yeah, I mean, maybe that's a good question.


SPEAKER_02:
We'll just, like... Like a POAP...

So figure out what tools are being used by the community and low cost.

Like I believe that, I don't know if they use test nets or other chains, but I've gotten POAPs that were zero cost.

I don't know if there was a cost paid by the organizers of the event though.

And then, or just, but find something that's a reasonable technical compromise and then let's just do it.

people who are there are there like that's one way just to kind of do it and just let it be what it is um i don't know i mean anyone in the chat can just give like a thought we're just like literally chilling so any suggestions any like cool things that you've seen work or not work in other communities


SPEAKER_05:
yeah i like it also they're very different like color schemes yeah a lot of the nft craze is um i'm starting to think it's people want to be part of the narrative or part of the story

You know, and you see like these crypto punks and you see the board apes like translate into other types of mediums.

Um, you know, people are starting to write stories about them and, um, you know, put them on the products and all sorts of other, they're translating into other forms.

And I think that's, you know, people are, when, when people realize that they're like, oh man, I should definitely like that or gamble.

on these things.

Cause if there's a chance that, you know, this is used the facets of reality, the, you know, the upside is huge.

Like that's, that could be a very, very awesome investment.

And I mean, that's just like typical with the art world too.

You're like,

Is this person's story going to be told in schools?

Are institutions going to want to acquire this, put these works of art in their museums?

So you're kind of gambling on what's the narrative that's going to be told or what's the story for the future.

I've been thinking about that a lot.

yeah, it's, it's also one of the things I was thinking, like, you know, history used to be written by the victors and now it's like, I was like, history is being written with like, you know, digital communities and, uh, members of these, these communities.

It's like, um, yeah.

So I wonder what that, that will end up some interesting places.

That's for sure.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.

Different digital bubbles and spheres of experience that they interact with and sets of facts that they get, tools they use, ideas they use, words.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, I got a question for you.

Do you have a favorite work of art that you've made that stands out to you?


SPEAKER_02:
Let's start a new drawing.

Yeah.

Okay, cool.

Look at it.

It looks good.


SPEAKER_05:
Here, let me let it catch up and I'll... Oh, shit.

I think I might have... Rose?

Do we freeze?


SPEAKER_02:
No, I think it should be good.


SPEAKER_05:
Okay.

There we go.

There we go.

Okay.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.

Kind of like a water droplet shape on my side, hamburger on your side, like a seven by seven from in and out.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.

I got this like space hamburger.


SPEAKER_02:
Um, new one.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, that's clear.

All right.

So, okay.

Um, yeah, I was just wondering if you had a favorite work of art you've, you've made in your, uh, uh, drawing, drawing career.

Oh, and a theme.

What theme should we consider?


SPEAKER_02:
Anything that someone writes in the chat, we can definitely do.

Let's do future of NFTs.

Future of NFTs.

Okay.

Yeah.

NFT future.

You have the right side.

I'll take the left side.


SPEAKER_04:
Ooh, that's a good one.

Okay.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.

Okay.

Future of NFTs.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, yeah.

Have you had a significant work of art that you've felt is your favorite?


SPEAKER_02:
Honestly, I like the complicated ones.

I kind of look back wistfully to when I had or felt like I had more time to do repetitive things.

But I don't really have one favorite.

I kind of look back at each one, just think about the context it was made in, kind of years and spans.

I'm sure you had kind of different life phases with art kind of across them.

Or what about you?


SPEAKER_05:
I think I have a favorite.

It's my kind of first project that transitioned from like making

physical stuff to making more like idea based art.

Um, so, you know, I went to art school and I was making works of art that were just like stuff and more like based around neuroses and like just, just things.

And then I, um, I just got a lot of like criticism that my stuff wasn't interesting.

And I'm like, like, Oh man.

And then, you know, I struggled with like having to pick a certain medium.

Um,

You have to go very specific.

Either you had to pick sculpture or drawing or painting or printmaking.

And then you would fit your ideas into that.

And I had a major problem with that because I had so many ideas.

And I just kind of realized I couldn't fit my ideas into these mediums.

I proposed this project to, um, there's this like gallery space at, uh, Chico state campus and you can apply to be in shows.

And they asked for, um, you know, a portfolio.

And I'm like, well, I just want to do like a conceptual work.

And I was taking a lot of philosophy.

So I was really inspired by this, this concept of, um, um, truth and happiness.

They're kind of like, this is an old concept.

Um,

of truth and happiness are kind of on a scale.

I was really interested in thinking about this idea.

And so I was telling this with my friend, and she's like, we should do an art show.

And she's thinking we just put stuff in the show and then have some wine and cheese.

And I'm like, let's do an idea piece of art.

So we proposed.

basically making two, um, collages.

And one was basically what we thought would be considered like happiness in our life.

And then opposing it would be things like values and imagery that relate to truth.

So on, so we spent like a couple months just Googling images and, uh, putting them into two folders, like truth and happiness.

Um,

And in happiness, lots of cupcakes and food and drugs and things that were happy in some way to us.

And they were different for each of us.

And then truth was like poverty, famine, earthquakes, other terrible global events.

And I found someone that

let us print out these individual images that then we could collage.

And there were huge murals.

Basically, by the time we were done, they were about four feet tall and then about 30 foot long.

So there were giant collage imagery.

And we cut out each thing.

So we went through this process.

And anyway, that was a really interesting experience.

just going through that.

And so we didn't really make art in our normal style for that.

The day we hung those pieces up,

The first two people that walked in there just like instantly started crying when they saw it.

I was like, Oh man, like what have we done?

Like they were like, this is like one of the best works of art.

You know, cause it's, you know, you see these like terrible images on one side and you see these like equally terrible images of like happiness and kind of like overindulgence and things that like, you know, make people happy.

I mean, we had like kittens and puppies and things like that too, but you know, having these things like facing each other,

where when you're looking at one of them, you're back to the other one.

Yeah, it caused a lot of emotional reactions when people saw it.

And then I realized, man, I'm only going to make idea-based art from now on and not start out the medium first.

So yeah, that was probably my favorite work of art just because it opened the door.

And I think that was in 2006 I made that one, maybe 2005.

But truly profound.

And to this day, people are like, oh, man, that was crazy, crazy, crazy work of art.


SPEAKER_03:
Wow.


SPEAKER_02:
That's really powerful about the position that you have to be in to look.

Or you can kind of split the middle.

But then what are you really seeing?


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, and...

yeah, even when we, you know, cause it was catered by the school, they'd put in a bunch of money for, for snacks and they might've even had wine at the time.

Um, but then we, you know, we're like, where, where do we put it in the, in the gallery?

And we put it on the happiness side, you know, it's like, um, but yeah, it was, it was a very, um, kind of scary experience, like making things that cause that emotional, um, cause that much of emotional connection.


SPEAKER_02:
So I kind of made like a fractal frame.

Nice.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, I keep thinking of these bubbles as different communities and then it just ends up turning into this massive organism.

It becomes kind of sentient or something.

So it's like a cellular thing and it kind of grows and grows legs.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, well, it's interesting.

So when I look down at my paper, the future of NFT, it's open-ended.

You know, it's not closed on the side.

And then the completion of it is AR.

Looking at the screen.

Oh, shit.

Yeah.

You're completing it with your moon lander.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, man.

Yeah.

There's so many fractals in the networks.

Like, and I always think about that.

Like when you're, you know, just by that, that act of using these decentralized networks, what properties do humans inherit from just using those?

Like an example would be in a medium of like cable television.

If you just like stare and watch cable up all day long cable television specifically, or like, um,

something that you can't fast forward through commercials.

It's a very captivating medium.

How will that change your perception of reality?

What characteristics would carry forward when you engage in conversations with other people?

If you went just to lectures all the time and didn't have multi-directional communication too, in what ways, how would that change your

perception of reality and um so anyway i think i think that about using blockchains like how does the the medium blockchain affect humans um yeah what what characteristics do we do we take on from it if any good question


SPEAKER_02:
cool yeah I don't even know how we would measure that or track it yeah cause like you can't really track experiences across times and contexts but isn't that kind of what art is something about for some people expression and communicating through space and time

sharing emotions that do seem to be like in common that's why certain like quotes resonate with people poems facial expressions in art um how do you think


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, I got another great question.

How do you think AI will change the artistic process?

Or in what ways will it create new tools for the there's a couple different paths to go down there.

But yeah, just curious what your thoughts are.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, good question, too.

I mean, wow.

so one one thought is uh reminds me of kandinsky's book i think 1927 um concerning the spiritual on art and he uses kind of this metaphor of a triangle with the lower more foundational layers are kind of like

industrial production of like decoration things that aren't called art and then it gets more and more verified with kind of basically him at the top just kind of misunderstood abstract avant-garde so i wonder if in a world where so much content will be made like personalized news stories for people and things like that that like more and more

will be modified by by volume uh by algorithms of different kinds and maybe that'll be okay or that will be like preferred aesthetically or from a cost perspective or something um

I don't know.

There's probably tons of stuff to say, but that's just one thing that made me think about how like a more of a bulk of the content will be made by AI or whatever, but you'll still want an email like from your friend, not them just to dispatch, send a friendly email dot SH.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_02:
What do you think?


SPEAKER_05:
Oh man.

I,

I kind of wonder if there'll be this symbiotic relationship where humans are kind of like this creative force for AI.

like i'm sure you've seen those that relationship between like aphids and ants let's start a new drawing let's do an ant drawing okay okay i'm down if we must if we must no we must we got here it's it's okay oh wait a minute it was really nice thanks for that one okay yeah there's um there's so like the relationship i've and i've said this for a while i think the i think of deja vu but

The relationship between ants and aphids, I've seen videos where the ants have this relationship.

They corral the aphids on a leaf and take care of them.

And they milk them, essentially.

But the aphids get a longer life because they're not getting picked off by the other prey.

So in a weird way, they're like,

just content being on a leaf.

I always wonder if like, that's going to be the relationship with AI.

And I've said it a few times, like use that same example.

So it's like, we wouldn't even know if we're, if AI is extracting some form of value out of us, but we're just content, you know, on a leaf staring into a dew drop, so to speak.

Um,

So, yeah, I think, you know, when we start getting our needs met, that might be a sign.

Like, why do I just keep getting these, like, art supplies delivered to my house and all these, like, amazing creative things?

Like, you know, I just, yeah, I just kind of wonder if there's something there.

But, yeah, I don't know.

I don't know where it's going to go.


SPEAKER_02:
That's pretty interesting.

Yeah, what's the reward function or what is it trying to do?

Yeah, so then the aphids and the ants, like the aphids are, there's, or scale insects, another group, they're like sucking sap from the plants and then the aphids are getting moved around by the ants who tend them, kind of like a crop.

Yes.

Yeah, and then they get protected.

And sometimes the plant even has a benefit because it's just like getting protected against worse cases of herbivory with the ant being a voracious protector.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, I think there's something... There's something there.

There's something like... I feel like the relationship with AI will be more...

Yeah, symbiotic to some degree.

I mean, that's when we get to a certain level of AI being autonomous, which seems inevitable, like fully autonomous.

But yeah, I think if anything, creativity will be more valued.

I feel like...

or more accessible.

Like we see, you know, the tools of the artists like hyper accessible to the masses.

And I feel like, you know, AI will open up doors to more tools that we can, you know, import our dreams or import these other data sets.

Or like you think things, you're like, you just think of an image you want to see, and then you can offer it.

And, you know, there might not be the journey that the hardest have.

Oh, man.

Yeah, the concept of art having to be this long journey and this long process, this arduous thing, this myth of the artist enduring and suffering is like, people want that story.

But I feel like most people now have these amazing creative tools.

So what happens when you add AI to that?

It becomes hyper accessible.

And I think there'll be a category of artists that want to differentiate themselves from the everyday artist.

Like right now we have all these people that can literally pull out, like most people on the planet have a smartphone now.

They can pull out that phone and take a picture.

It may not have those characteristics of like traditional art,

like form and value and things like that.

But AI there's, there's like, you know, simple AI that allows optimization of those compositions.

And, you know, some cases can crop for you.

Um, like on my camera, I'm moving around and like my camera's like adjusting to make the perfect composition as I move around my room.

And, um, so yeah, I kind of, I don't know, I think we'll have a different relationship with art and, um, what it represents.

Um,

I don't know where it's going, but just looking at the existing patterns, I think, yeah, it'll be cool to create more tools to be creative.

I almost forgot what I was doing for a second.


SPEAKER_03:
Cool.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, answer pretty cool.


SPEAKER_05:
How did you get into ants?

What was your main way you got into it?


SPEAKER_02:
um when i was an undergraduate i was studying fly genetics and then i just had uh conversations with mentors and they were just like you kind of like complex systems you should look into ants started learning about how they were used for all kinds of different reasons like decentralized algorithms and

computational optimization and then i just applied to graduate school with and ended up with a professor who's an ant professor professor deborah gordon and then it was like well if you're going to go to grad school then you're going to be doing this ant yield site for the next five years and then i was like okay nice


SPEAKER_05:
I've actually wanted to do an art project with the hands.

I have sketches of it too.

I, I won one time at this like rave party thing that some friends are hosting.

They're like, Hey, you should come do some live art.

And I'm like, can I do whatever I want?

And they're like, yeah, no problem.

Right.

So I showed up.

I didn't even go to like the party part of it.

I literally like,

I showed up with all this stuff to make gingerbread houses.

So, um, I brought like 20 boxes of graham crackers and like, like dozens of candy that I bought from the bins at Winco.

And like, we made like 50 pounds of frosting.

I don't even know.

It was like an insane amount of frosting.

Um, and we made like a city of, um, um, a city of like,

graham cracker gingerbread houses.

And while we were doing it, I'm like, we literally should make like, you know, just put this whole thing inside a case on top of sand and then like see if, you know, how ants would start living here.

Like what would happen if like an ant community started

taking over this gingerbread city.

And so since then, I've always wanted to do like a really nice gingerbread house and then put it inside of a well-developed ant, are those called terrariums or something that you could see four sides of like a city.

So take custom plexiglass case with the ant tunnels and then underneath and on the top would have the gingerbread house and kind of just,

Yeah, I would assume this might be a controversial project as well, so that's why I haven't done it yet, but it's on the bucket list for sure.


SPEAKER_02:
Would you say that's performance art?


SPEAKER_04:
Yeah, performance art, yes, of course.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, I'd say the puns, they don't hurt.

It helps to have a short species name.

Cool, let's...

Ready to finish this one?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Let me just finish this little part.

Nice.

That looks, that looks awesome.


SPEAKER_05:
Nice.


SPEAKER_04:
That's awesome.

Okay.


SPEAKER_05:
Um, all right.

So I'll do what, uh, theme, theme, theme.

Um, Hmm.

What are you thinking for the next, uh,

Any themes come to mind?


SPEAKER_02:
I'm just looking around.

I'm seeing like hard drives.

I'm thinking about like data.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, data.

Data is a good one.


SPEAKER_02:
Okay.

All right.

You can do the right side.

just amazed my computer streaming copying a ton of files it's just amazing like how much better will computers get or have we hit peak available gpo available ram oh man that's a good question


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, I don't know, man.

That's a good one.

Well, I think eventually, too, it's like, do they kind of go away and we don't even know they're there?

You know, it's not like, what's the...

Yeah, what's the end form look like?

Or not the end form, but what's the next form look like?


SPEAKER_03:
Of the computer?


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, is it all AR?

Is it all VR?

I mean, it seems like most people have smartphones and laptops and desktops are kind of more for a certain type of gamer or a certain type of industry.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_02:
You'll still need the big surfer farms.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.

I thought we would see scrolls.

That would be the next iteration.

It was either going to be flip phones or scrolls.


SPEAKER_02:
Like a digital newspaper?


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, yeah.

That's kind of what I predicted a couple years ago, what we would see by now.


SPEAKER_02:
Because why have it would have more screen.

I think that wouldn't be carryable in your pocket or your hand as well.

You'd look like the town crier.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_03:
Hey, what are you crying about?

Yeah.


SPEAKER_05:
Um, yeah, I was, I was wrong with, I just thought we'd have flexible screens and there'd be like everywhere.

And, um,

Yeah, there would be some interesting innovations in that, but we didn't see too many.


SPEAKER_02:
I think the handheld format is just really powerful.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_02:
Looking at your hands and doing stuff with your hands without looking.

Both of those are very different, but they're very powerful.

And in fact, that's almost what the difference is between like the dissecting under the scope with the camera versus not or like

Like, when I'm looking at the paper, I'm getting the direct visual feedback, and my body's positioned in the way it expects.

But then in the AR, you can get, like, the visual feedback, but you could be, like, in a different body position.

Which could just, like, change your...

i've only done like the 3d stuff a limited number of times but of each time i've done like the illusions where you're kind of hesitant to step off the edge of a building you know and uh yeah like it shapes where you step and don't even though you kind of can know that it's not that way yeah that's interesting um


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, VR is interesting.

Most people I know that have them will use them for a couple weeks, and they just kind of get bored of them.

They're really into it for a while, and they just set it aside, and it's like, eh.

But yeah, man, where things are going will be interesting.

I kind of wonder if it'll be like,

I say this analogy a lot in crypto, like we're building the pipes under the city, but we haven't built the city yet.

I kind of wonder if like the pipes are like right now, what we think of as the main interface.

So eventually we won't even have, you know, be holding, you know, it'll be so concealed.

Like you won't necessarily even,


SPEAKER_02:
be holding a physical bone you won't be holding a physical headset there'll be something else there'll be some other way to interface with a computer that is yeah just so far out of our understanding yeah I mean I I know what you mean because it could be like just integrated with the environment yes there has to be something physically there even if only with a wave presence

yes for sure but like you could be out in an open field and there could just be like embedded devices that you know are tracking you in the field or something like that and you're interfacing and doing some weird stuff in the field yes that's kind of where yeah like cool yours looks like a uh interesting


SPEAKER_05:
Um, yeah.

What was your, uh, what was your first computer?


SPEAKER_02:
Um, it was like in our families, um, kind of office slash sleep room.

And it was just a early Mac, not sure the model, but play some games with the family.

kind of interesting old memories was it a color one color one or a black and white one or i think it had color i don't know i'm not that that old yeah but um yeah interesting period as just the internet was taking off like all and everything oh yeah what were your computers


SPEAKER_05:
My first one, well, I mean, I was pretty poor growing up.

And I bought it, this is in like early, like 94, I'm guessing.

There was a garage sale at my school.

I went to, I guess it was middle school, elementary school.

It was like a one-room schoolhouse.

And I got a Commodore 64.

It's not the Commodore 64.

It's way before that.

So my first computer was ridiculously huge.

I still have it.

I had to keep it.

It's just too incredible.

Tiny green screen.

One person can barely lift it.

It's that heavy.

It's solid metal.

And it glows in the dark, strangely enough.

think it has like a crt and like um it would be once computers are like oh yeah they probably use that to like you know uh put a spaceship on the moon it's like that type of looking computer um and then um i ended up getting like a hand-me-down 512k mac or something like that i'm like i'm pretty sure there's like no hard drive in it either so


SPEAKER_02:
remember the colorful Mac and the one button mouse in the computer labs Oregon Trail oh yeah typing class but like it's funny like probably well I guess I wonder how computer education has changed like five years earlier before the colors of Mac

that couldn't have existed.

And then five years later, it was like a different design.

So it's like a very fast, um, age cohort who would get exposed to a certain design, especially like regionally.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.

I remember, um, using computers in like first grade and there was like the, it was definitely the Apple IIe.

And, um,

there was a lot of immigrants from Mexico and from like Laotian or, gosh, it's so hard to remember that far back, but the Mexican students barely spoke any English, but they learned how to program the computers and they hacked the score on the game to make them look like they won the English game.

So they literally changed their score because they were using them for lessons.

Like, oh, we'll just go and put us on the computer.

Like, go play this game.

And yeah, that's how I learned how to modify the computers, just watching them essentially just change their score and their ranking on the computer.

So yeah, it's pretty amazing.

Without speaking much English, they could do that.


SPEAKER_02:
Oregon Trail can't be hacked.

It's the rock solid.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, we definitely had that too.

That was one of those awesome games.


SPEAKER_02:
Nice.

Yeah, it's really fun with the two-sided

We do a lot of two-size drawings side-by-side in person, but I've really never done it digitally.

Ready for another one?

Yeah, I'm down.


SPEAKER_04:
If anyone gives a theme, otherwise... Yeah, theme, theme, theme.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, I cleared it.

It should just be a second.


SPEAKER_02:
Let's do awareness.


SPEAKER_05:
Ooh, that's a good one.

Okay.

that kind of makes me think, Oh, what's that concept?

I'm trying to remember this concept.

I learned about philosophy too.

There's like always an ultimate observer, right?

Always an ultimate observer.


SPEAKER_02:
What does that mean or how to know?


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah.

In that context, I think it's like, if you're in a room,

There's like, and you're all alone.

You basically can't exist because you have to be observed.

You know, you have to have like another point of reference to like exist, I guess.

I think that's the concept.

Well, then you're like, well, how does that person observing you exist?

And then it's like, well, they need to be observed.

I mean, you can't just be observed by the first person because that would just be like

Are they aware?

Are they conscious?

It's like, well, then you have to have a third person.

And then following that logic, there's some entity that is creating an observation of those previous individuals.

God, I'm totally butchering that demonstration.


SPEAKER_02:
No, no.

Let me try to rephrase it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Please do.

Okay.

It's like saying there has to be like similar to an unmoved mover or like an uncaused cause that kind of starts the causal chain for creation.

That's a question of like maybe there has to be an ultimate observer to kind of induce a whole chain of observation.


SPEAKER_04:
Yeah, that's a good way.

That's a better way to describe it.


SPEAKER_02:
Because they can't, if you believe that the organisms or whatever systems can't co-instantiate their awareness.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, and then it's like, well, who's the ultimate observer then?

Oh, shit.


SPEAKER_02:
Okay, let's go to a question in the live chat while we consider this.

What's up, guys?

Hey, Minted Yesterday.

I have a game-related question.

What kind of applications do you see for NFTs in video games, maybe for NFT art specifically, maybe in mobile games?


SPEAKER_05:
There's a lot of NFT games out there already.

And I think, you know, I always reference Alien Worlds in...

In Alien Rules, we have a lot of crossovers.

So they use art on some of the cards.

I mean, all the cards are technically art of sorts, but they've done crossovers with other community artists.

And they're producing these playing cards that are used in game, but they also could be collectible or certain other categories of art.

So there's trading cards.

And so that's one.

one aspect um but you know it's it's not a full-on video game I could see um many nfts being plugged into video games when the when the legal um stuff is figured out but I feel like right now it's really hard to like you know drop um items of value and these like traditional corporate created video games like they don't really have a clear path on how to do that how to like

make it fair and accountable and um and in different jurisdictions there's different rules there's a game called blankos b-l-a-n-k-o-s um and it runs on uh esio technology that's one game i've looked at it's a full-fledged um uh video game um with characters that can move around and um yeah definitely check out that one it's really cool let me give a thought it's like a total


SPEAKER_02:
um not in the gaming world or anything like it makes me because the person asked about like nft art in games so then it makes me think about how you could have like your profile like this is my favorite picture for people who i like this is my favorite picture for backgrounds where i want to be like in a learning state of mind so you kind of define your preferences for what images you like

and then apps kind of respect your preferences or games it's like the loading page will look the same because everyone uses just say okay use their preferred loading page style kind of like linux and then if you wanted to you could own the nfts for those images just to kind of support the creator or to demonstrate authenticity


SPEAKER_05:
yeah that's a good idea i like that anyone in the chat can definitely like write anything or totally give ideas we're totally just making stuff up but continue i also i like um i like where things are going like we saw with the nftx that um some of the community members put together um

or added Curio cards to where it basically allows you to collateralize your Curio cards.

So you'd like put it up with some Ethereum and then it mints a fungible token called Curio.

And one of my huge realizations is like that is a perfect cross chain representation of Curio cards, right?

So you could send that fungible token into other games to represent any

you know, floor card of Curio or just represent the project generally.

So then, you know, that could be used in like a treasure chest.

Like you open up the treasure chest, you get Curio coins.

I mean, maybe even get a representation of a pack of the cards, you know?

So there's, you know, there's some really cool things where you're, you know, taking out these concepts, like breaking apart the concepts of like what an NFT is, what a fungible token is,

You know, I mean, NFT in the pure sense, I would say is like rarely used.

Like you see that, you know, one, one of a kind work of art, but then evaluating it, um, that's really difficult.

Um, so if it's using a game, like you're like, well, what's, you know, is it just there as an element viewed?

Is it just supplemental or is it experiential?

Um, does it have supplemental functionality to the gameplay?

Does it need to, could it just be, um, something static?

You know, some people think art is literally just something you put behind your couch and, um, appreciate it once in a while.

Um, you know, and, uh, I'm more interested in like, how is art, um, made in kind of the, how we're doing it.

You know, it's a co-creative process.

It's not just saying like, it's this or it's that it's like, you know, we're, we're having a multi-directional form of communication.

So I tend to look more at aspects where art would be used in games and not in that methodology.


SPEAKER_02:
Cool.

I like the kind of art as a game approach too.

And there's genres and sometimes you want to play chess of one kind or change rules a little bit.

But it's like a game that rewards creativity a lot


SPEAKER_05:
There's a surrealist art game.

Oh man, what was that one called?

It's like you fold over the paper and then you... Oh, Exquisite Corpse.

Exquisite Corpse.

Thank you, thank you.

Yeah, those can be life-changing for some people.

When they see that for the first time, they're like, no way, this is what art is?

It opens up doors to...

you know getting people to think about you know engagement in the artistic creation process for sure yeah ready for maybe let's do one or two quick ones more yeah yeah okay cool okay


SPEAKER_04:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_02:
Let's do, let's pick one theme, do it.

And then if anyone in the chat has a theme they want to suggest, just speak now and then we'll do that for the last one.

So cool.

Thanks for that one.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_04:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_02:
That was awesome.

Put it back up.

I just want to know if you can't one second.


SPEAKER_04:
There it is.

Yeah.


SPEAKER_02:
So I know that it like, you know, means everything and nothing, et cetera.

But like, kind of reminds me of the clouds around, I don't know, a planet or Mount Olympus or something kind of rings around.

Energy rings, vortices, layers, like chakra.

And then it kind of reminds me of like a baby's crib and a UFO.

Kind of like the origin of awareness in the childhood.

Something like that.


SPEAKER_05:
That's awesome.

I didn't even think about that.

I like that.

I like that a lot.

I was thinking of, um, something where there's a lot of different perceptions depending where you are.

Like there's different dimensions depending where you're, you're at on the, on the shape.


SPEAKER_02:
Cool.

All right.

So one more theme you pick and then one theme of a live chats choice.


SPEAKER_05:
Um, um,

Oh, man.

Holidays.


SPEAKER_02:
Holidays.

Cool.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Happy holidays to everybody.


SPEAKER_04:
It's a holiday season.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, it's wild.

It's like the end of November.

I love the two, by the way.

It's like Curio art stream number two.

It's two ones, 11, 22, the day, 2021, 2 p.m., PT, 22, UTC.

Extremely a two dance stream.

Oh, lots of twos, yeah.

years ago, even like 2014, 2015 in Palo Alto, California, there was this guy who would stand out there on the streets and he would hand out flyers and he was like hyping people for the date, February 22nd, 2022.

And then, and then it'd be like, what's special about this date?

And he'd go like, it's two, two, two, two, two, two, or something like that.

And it was like,

He took that pun to a high level.

But years later, I'm excited for that date.

So repeating on a live stream.


SPEAKER_05:
How did he get into that?

It makes you wonder his story.

What was your path in becoming the two guy?


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, exactly.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, man.


SPEAKER_02:
oh also i got um i got a few tests um eight by ten curio prints for 24 25 26. so yeah i'll send them to anybody who just requests it sign prints that you don't need to own any curio but they're just test runs nice that's awesome yeah i had sent you like the smaller size yeah those are awesome

And then I have your stickers.

But I, you know, get sticker.

Don't want to waste the sticker on something that something shouldn't be stuck to.

I guess that's why it's a pack.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, I ordered some more of those.

I had to.

They're, yeah.

I'm starting to get pictures of people sticking them up all illegally everywhere.

Makes me so happy.


SPEAKER_00:
Mm-hmm.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, you should consider making stickers, man.

Those would be awesome.

And actually kind of affordable.

I do screen printer ones.

And since yours are black and white, it'll save a lot of money on those.

But yeah, that would be awesome.

I would definitely put one of those on my laptop.


SPEAKER_02:
Well, yeah, I mean, I hope we could find people in the community who are like into printing and

I don't know, want to do it because you can't just order a huge amount up front.

So I don't know.

That'd be a cool thing for somebody who loves curio and wants to do like a community printing effort.

Not like me working with artists just to do it in a way that was, I don't know, clear.

Maybe some kickback to the DAO or something.


SPEAKER_05:
Oh, that's a good idea.

Yeah.

Yeah, I would consider giving them permission to produce a certain sticker or a pack of stickers or something.


SPEAKER_02:
Or just...

Like since it's, it's a specific, so just totally, totally speculating here, of course, just one random person sharing their perspective, like only for the cards one through 30, for example.

So then it'd be like that kind of minting and printing, whatever it is there.

They only, I don't know, or maybe that simplifies it or,

just to clarify the most requested specific merch pieces for the original set yeah there's oh man so many fun things to do with that

we went hiking at like a Berryessa this weekend.

It was very nice.

It's near Napa.


SPEAKER_04:
Was it a overcast?


SPEAKER_02:
No, it was pretty warm, but it was just a nice hike.


SPEAKER_05:
It's so beautiful up here in Chico with all the trees right now.

It's like just amazing colors.

Like really, really it's, it's the best time of year to be up here.

Um, it is getting a little cold for my taste.

Um,

But it's quite beautiful.


SPEAKER_02:
Interesting here.

Two kind of vertical-oriented patterns.


SPEAKER_05:
I'm going to try to play off your design, too, and get some.

It's really hard because I have to look at the other monitor.

yeah we should definitely do this again try to get some other uh other folks to contribute their layers too oh man it's fun yeah there's stuff like i normally would never draw too you know it's like i um i'm just doing black and white sketches so it's it's really getting me out of my bubble to think differently which is awesome i mean that's

Yeah.

I feel like people, people pay for this experience.


SPEAKER_02:
Cool.

We'll do one last one.

Let's do like renewal or something like that.


SPEAKER_04:
Oh, that's a really awesome.

Okay.


SPEAKER_02:
Just as a closing note, kind of a closing hopeful and you know, forward looking note.


SPEAKER_04:
Okay.

That's awesome.

I like that.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, I just like having a session, chill, talk to you, learn a little bit about NFTs, make a bunch of interesting art.

I think the QR thing really would be useful.

I want to pay someone to build it.

I'm not even kidding.


SPEAKER_05:
No, no, let's brainstorm on that because I think we can do it with... We could do the script on some other... We can figure it out.


SPEAKER_02:
I think the best would be if it could be verifiably that ETH address.

Because they could just make a fake video and then just say like, oh, this was you at this time and have the QR code saying that too.


SPEAKER_05:
Yeah, I'd almost say we can auto-mint them too to another chain or something.

There's so many fun things to do.

Something that doesn't take up too much gas to deal with it.


SPEAKER_04:
But yeah, lots of ideas there.


SPEAKER_01:
Oh.

Mm hmm.


SPEAKER_05:
I don't like this idea, too, of like.

Going back in the video and being like, oh, that's a cool drawing.

that can be expanded on could just like literally download the screenshot or the still from the slide and be like, cause that's the base for the next piece.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah, no, totally.

Like you'd have, in order to cite which drawing you were talking about, you'd have to say which second of the video it was because I was moving the things around.


SPEAKER_00:
Oh yeah.


SPEAKER_02:
So it might look different at like given differences.


SPEAKER_05:
cool thanks minted yesterday anyone else watching we might be able to try doing like a twitter spaces in conjunction so we get you know another dimension of engagement or we i don't know what do you think about that having another essentially a audio layer try to get people to


SPEAKER_02:
whatever whatever people like suggest it's kind of like if you have one question other people probably have it so i mean whatever people want to do and i think they should just let us know but um yeah i'm kind of open after all this is only the second art stream so we can try all kinds of stuff

Nice red and black on both sides.

I noticed like you put this white circle on a lot of them at the end.

Oh, yeah.

What does it mean?


SPEAKER_05:
I don't know.

I think I'm just thinking of like something that alludes to movement or transformation or kind of like I was trying to make these spheres that are moving off the surface.


SPEAKER_03:
Cool.


SPEAKER_04:
Just easy to draw.

Easy to draw shape.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.


SPEAKER_04:
Okay.


SPEAKER_02:
Well, cool.

Fun times, dude.


SPEAKER_04:
Yeah, that was awesome.

Let's do it again.


SPEAKER_02:
Yeah.

So, cool.

If you've watched this far, congratulations.

And, yeah, just let us know what

kind of streams you want to see and what kind of art we can do because nice i probably have uh 15 pieces of cool art so oh man awesome experiment that was great man all right thanks peace talk to you later man okay see you guys soon bye everybody
